	abstract = {Among the more than 40 genera of anthropoid primates (monkeys, apes, and humans), only the South American owl monkeys, genus Aotus, are nocturnal. However, the southernmostly distributed species, Aotus azarai azarai, of the Gran Chaco may show considerable amounts of its 24-h activity during bright daylight. Due to seasonal changes in the duration of photophase and climatic parameters in their subtropical habitat, the timing and pattern of their daily activity are expected to show significant seasonal variation. By quantitative long-term activity recordings with Actiwatch AW4 accelerometer data logger devices of 10 wild owl monkeys inhabiting a gallery forest in Formosa, Argentina, the authors analyzed the seasonal variation in the temporal niche and activity pattern resulting from entrainment and masking of the circadian activity rhythm by seasonally and diurnally varying environmental factors. The owl monkeys always displayed a distinct bimodal activity pattern, with prominent activity bouts and peaks during dusk and dawn. Their activity rhythm showed distinct lunar and seasonal variations in the timing and daily pattern. During the summer, the monkeys showed predominantly crepuscular/nocturnal behavior, and a crepuscular/cathemeral activity pattern with similar diurnal and nocturnal activity levels during the cold winter months. The peak times of the evening and morning activity bouts were more closely related to the times of sunset and sunrise, respectively, than activity-onset and -offset. Obviously, they were better circadian markers for the phase position of the entrained activity rhythm than activity-onset and -offset, which were subject to more masking effects of environmental and/or internal factors. Total daily activity was lowest during the two coldest lunar months, and almost twice as high during the warmest months. Nighttime (21:00–06:00 h) and daytime (09:00–18:00 h) activity varied significantly across the year, but in an opposite manner. Highest nighttime activity occurred in summer and maximal daytime activity during the cold winter months. Dusk and dawn activity, which together accounted for 43\% of the total daily activity, barely changed. The monkeys tended to terminate their nightly activity period earlier on warm and rainy days, whereas the daily amount of activity showed no significant correlation either with temperature or precipitation. These data are consistent with the dual-oscillator hypothesis of circadian regulation. They suggest the seasonal variations of the timing and pattern of daily activity in wild owl monkeys of the Argentinean Chaco result from a specific interplay of light entrainment of circadian rhythmicity and strong masking effects of various endogenous and environmental factors. Since the phase position of the monkeys' evening and morning activity peaks did not vary considerably over the year, the seasonal change from a crepuscular/nocturnal activity pattern in summer to a more crepuscular/cathemeral one in winter does not depend on a corresponding phase shift of the entrained circadian rhythm, but mainly on masking effects. Thermoregulatory and energetic demands and constraints seem to play a crucial role. (Author correspondence: hans.erkert@t-online.de)},

	abstract = {1. Many plants produce extrafloral nectar (EFN) to nourish ants and other animals which defend them against herbivores. We aimed to find reasons for the high variability in amounts of EFN produced by most plant species. We investigated the influence of several biotic and abiotic factors (time of day, leaf age, nectar removal and leaf damage) on secretion rates of EFN in the common south-east Asian pioneer tree species, Macaranga tanarius (L.) Muell. Arg. 2. In most experiments leaves were washed with pure water and bagged in nets to protect them against nectar-collecting insects, and nectar was collected and quantified 24 h later. Six soluble sugars and up to eight amino acids were detected in nectar samples derived from untreated, field-grown plants. Total amounts of soluble substances varied more than the relative composition of EFN. 3. Nectar secretion rates were highest on young, expanded leaves. A diurnal pattern with a secretion peak in the first 2 h after dusk was detected in the field. Nectar removal had a positive effect and its accumulation a negative effect on further EFN production. Artificial leaf damage (punching leaves with a needle or removing parts of the leaf blade with scissors) led to a significant induction of EFN production for the next 3 days. 4. Extrafloral nectar of M. tanarius was secreted in complex patterns influenced by different biotic and abiotic factors; its production appeared to be adapted temporally and spatially in order to ensure optimal use of invested resources.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock of the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana modulates defense mechanisms impacting plant–pathogen interactions. Nevertheless, the effect of clock regulation on pathogenic traits has not been explored in detail. Moreover, molecular description of clocks in pathogenic fungi—or fungi in general other than the model ascomycete Neurospora crassa—has been neglected, leaving this type of question largely unaddressed. We sought to characterize, therefore, the circadian system of the plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea to assess if such oscillatory machinery can modulate its virulence potential. Herein, we show the existence of a functional clock in B. cinerea, which shares similar components and circuitry with the Neurospora circadian system, although we found that its core negative clock element FREQUENCY (BcFRQ1) serves additional roles, suggesting extracircadian functions for this protein. We observe that the lesions produced by this necrotrophic fungus on Arabidopsis leaves are smaller when the interaction between these two organisms occurs at dawn. Remarkably, this effect does not depend solely on the plant clock, but instead largely relies on the pathogen circadian system. Genetic disruption of the B. cinerea oscillator by mutation, overexpression of BcFRQ1, or by suppression of its rhythmicity by constant light, abrogates circadian regulation of fungal virulence. By conducting experiments with out-of-phase light:dark cycles, we confirm that indeed, it is the fungal clock that plays the main role in defining the outcome of the Arabidopsis–Botrytis interaction, providing to our knowledge the first evidence of a microbial clock modulating pathogenic traits at specific times of the day.},

	abstract = {The organisms of most domains of life have adapted to circadian changes of the environment and regulate their behavior and physiology accordingly. A particular case of such paradigm is represented by some types of host-pathogen interaction during infection. Indeed, not only some hosts and pathogens are each endowed with their own circadian clock, but they are also influenced by the circadian changes of the other with profound consequences on the outcome of the infection. It comes that daily fluctuations in the availability of resources and the nature of the immune response, coupled with circadian changes of the pathogen, may influence microbial virulence, level of colonization and damage to the host, and alter the equilibrium between commensal and invading microorganisms. In the present review, we discuss the potential relevance of circadian rhythms in human bacterial and fungal pathogens, and the consequences of circadian changes of the host immune system and microbiome on the onset and development of infection. By looking from the perspective of the interplay between host and microbes circadian rhythms, these concepts are expected to change the way we approach human infections, not only by predicting the outcome of the host-pathogen interaction, but also by indicating the best time for intervention to potentiate the anti-microbial activities of the immune system and to weaken the pathogen when its susceptibility is higher.},

	abstract = {In the genus Petunia, distinct pollination syndromes may have evolved in association with bee-visitation (P. integrifolia spp.) or hawk moth-visitation (P. axillaris spp). We investigated the extent of congruence between ﬂoral fragrance and olfactory perception of the hawk moth Manduca sexta. Hawk moth pollinated P. axillaris releases high levels of several compounds compared to the bee-pollinated P. integrifolia that releases benzaldehyde almost exclusively. The three dominating compounds in P. axillaris were benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol and methyl benzoate. In P. axillaris, benzenoids showed a circadian rhythm with an emission peak at night, which was absent from P. integrifolia. These characters were highly conserved among diﬀerent P. axillaris subspecies and P. axillaris accessions, with some diﬀerences in fragrance composition. Electroantennogram (EAG) recordings using ﬂower-blends of diﬀerent wild Petunia species on female M. sexta antennae showed that P. axillaris odours elicited stronger responses than P. integrifolia odours. EAG responses were highest to the three dominating compounds in the P. axillaris ﬂower odours. Further, EAG responses to odour-samples collected from P. axillaris ﬂowers conﬁrmed that odours collected at night evoked stronger responses from M. sexta than odours collected during the day. These results show that timing of odour emissions by P. axillaris is in tune with nocturnal hawk moth activity and that ﬂower-volatile composition is adapted to the antennal perception of these pollinators.},

To facilitate these interactions, many flowers are known to display their attractive qualities, such as scent emission and petal opening, in a daily rhythmic fashion. However, less is known about how the internal timing mechanisms (the circadian clocks) of plants and animals influence their daily interactions. We examine the role of the circadian clock in modulating the interaction between Petunia and one of its pollinators, the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. We find that desynchronization of the Petunia circadian clock affects moth visitation preference for Petunia flowers. Similarly, moths with circadian time aligned to plants show stronger flower-foraging activities than moths that lack this alignment. Moth locomotor activity is circadian clock-regulated, although it is also strongly repressed by light. Moths show a time-dependent burst increase in flight activity during subjective night. In addition, moth antennal responsiveness to the floral scent compounds exhibits a 24-hour rhythm in both continuous light and dark conditions. This study highlights the importance of the circadian clocks in both plants and animals as a crucial factor in initiating specialized plant-pollinator relationships.},

	abstract = {Native to Southeast Asia, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) is a recent invader that infests intact ripe and ripening fruit, leading to significant crop losses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Since current D. suzukii management strategies rely heavily on insecticide usage and insecticide detoxification gene expression is under circadian regulation in the closely related Drosophila melanogaster, we set out to determine if integrative analysis of daily activity patterns and detoxification gene expression can predict chronotoxicity of D. suzukii to insecticides. Locomotor assays were performed under conditions that approximate a typical summer or winter day in Watsonville, California, where D. suzukii was first detected in North America. As expected, daily activity patterns of D. suzukii appeared quite different between ‘summer’ and ‘winter’ conditions due to differences in photoperiod and temperature. In the ‘summer’, D. suzukii assumed a more bimodal activity pattern, with maximum activity occurring at dawn and dusk. In the ‘winter’, activity was unimodal and restricted to the warmest part of the circadian cycle. Expression analysis of six detoxification genes and acute contact bioassays were performed at multiple circadian times, but only in conditions approximating Watsonville summer, the cropping season, when most insecticide applications occur. Five of the genes tested exhibited rhythmic expression, with the majority showing peak expression at dawn (ZT0, 6am). We observed significant differences in the chronotoxicity of D. suzukii towards malathion, with highest susceptibility at ZT0 (6am), corresponding to peak expression of cytochrome P450s that may be involved in bioactivation of malathion. High activity levels were not found to correlate with high insecticide susceptibility as initially hypothesized. Chronobiology and chronotoxicity of D. suzukii provide valuable insights for monitoring and control efforts, because insect activity as well as insecticide timing and efficacy are crucial considerations for pest management. However, field research is necessary for extrapolation to agricultural settings.},

At the farm level, human operators typically must perform periodical surveys of the traps disseminated through the field. This is a labor-, time- and cost-consuming activity, in particular for large plantations or large forestry areas, so it would be of great advantage to have an affordable system capable of doing this task automatically in an accurate and a more efficient way. This paper proposes an autonomous monitoring system based on a low-cost image sensor that it is able to capture and send images of the trap contents to a remote control station with the periodicity demanded by the trapping application. Our autonomous monitoring system will be able to cover large areas with very low energy consumption. This issue would be the main key point in our study; since the operational live of the overall monitoring system should be extended to months of continuous operation without any kind of maintenance (i.e., battery replacement). The images delivered by image sensors would be time-stamped and processed in the control station to get the number of individuals found at each trap. All the information would be conveniently stored at the control station, and accessible via Internet by means of available network services at control station (WiFi, WiMax, 3G/4G, etc.).},

One of the least understood aspects of life in the dark biosphere is the rhythmicity of physiology and what it means to live in an environment of low or no rhythmicity. Here we describe methods that may be used to understand rhythmic physiology in the dark and summarise some of the studies of rhythmic physiology in “arrhythmic” environments, such as the poles, deep sea and caves.

Aerial predation is a highly complex, three-dimensional flight behavior that affects the individual fitness and population dynamics of both predator and prey. Most studies of predation adopt either an ecological approach in which capture or survival rates are quantified, or a biomechanical approach in which the physical interaction is studied in detail. In the present study, we show that combining these two approaches provides insight into the interaction between hunting dragonflies (Libellula cyanea) and their prey (Drosophila melanogaster) that neither type of study can provide on its own. We performed {\textgreater}2500 predation trials on nine dragonflies housed in an outdoor artificial habitat to identify sources of variability in capture success, and analyzed simultaneous predator–prey flight kinematics from 50 high-speed videos. The ecological approach revealed that capture success is affected by light intensity in some individuals but that prey density explains most of the variability in success rate. The biomechanical approach revealed that fruit flies rarely respond to approaching dragonflies with evasive maneuvers, and are rarely successful when they do. However, flies perform random turns during flight, whose characteristics differ between individuals, and these routine, erratic turns are responsible for more failed predation attempts than evasive maneuvers. By combining the two approaches, we were able to determine that the flies pursued by dragonflies when prey density is low fly more erratically, and that dragonflies are less successful at capturing them. This highlights the importance of considering the behavior of both participants, as well as their biomechanics and ecology, in developing a more integrative understanding of organismal interactions.},

Our model shows that nocturnality is typically beneficial when predation risk is higher during the day than during the night, but this is reversed by the energetic benefit of diurnality when food becomes scarce. Empirical testing under semi-natural conditions revealed that the daily timing of activity and rest in mice exposed to manipulations in energy availability and perceived predation risk is in line with the model’s predictions. Low food availability and decreased perceived daytime predation risk promote diurnal activity patterns. Overall, our results identify temporal niche switching in small mammals as a strategy to maximise survival in response to environmental changes in food availability and perceived predation risk.},

The majority of drosophilids including the best known Drosophila melanogaster only breed on decaying fruits. On the contrary, the presence of a strong serrated ovipositor and behavioural and metabolic adaptations allow D. suzukii to lay eggs inside healthy, ripening fruits that are still on the plant. Here we present an analysis of the rhythmic locomotor activity behaviour of D. suzukii under several laboratory settings. Moreover, we identify the canonical clock neurons in this species by reporting the expression pattern of the major clock proteins in the brain. Interestingly, a fundamentally similar organisation of the clock neurons network between D. melanogaster and D. suzukii does not correspond to similar characteristics in rhythmic locomotor activity behaviour.},

	abstract = {Understanding behavioral rhythms in a pest species can contribute to improving the efficacy of control methods targeting that pest. However, in some species, the behavioral patterns recorded in artificial conditions contrast greatly with observed wild-type behavioral rhythms. In this study, we identify the determinants of daily activity rhythms of the soft and stone fruit pest Drosophila suzukii. The impact of gender, space, social housing, temperature, light, fly morph, and the circadian clock on D. suzukii locomotor rhythms was investigated. Assays were performed under artificial laboratory conditions or more natural semifield conditions to identify how these factors affected daily locomotor behavior. Daily locomotor activity patterns collected under semifield conditions varied very little between the various sex and social condition combinations. However, in lab-based assays, individual and group-housed males often exhibited divergent activity patterns, with more prominent hyperactivity at light/dark transitions. In contrast, hyperactivity responses were suppressed under lab protocols mimicking summer conditions for groups of females and mixed-sex groups. Moreover, when environmental cues were removed, flies held in groups displayed stronger rhythmicity than individual flies. Thus, social interactions can reinforce circadian behavior and resist hyperactivity responses in D. suzukii. Fly morph appeared to have little impact on behavioral pattern, with winter and summer morph flies displaying similar activity profiles under April semifield and laboratory mimic environmental conditions. In conclusion, separate and combined effects of light, temperature, circadian clock function, and social interactions were apparent in the daily activity profiles of D. suzukii. When groups of female or mixed-sex flies were used, implementation of matching photoperiods and realistic daily temperature gradients in the lab was sufficient to re-create behavioral patterns observed in summer semifield settings. The ability to leverage lab assays to predict D. suzukii field behavior promises to be a valuable asset in improving control measures for this pest.},

	abstract = {Animals should time activities, such as foraging, migration and reproduction, as well as seasonal physiological adaptation, in a way that maximizes fitness. The fitness outcome of such activities depends largely on their interspecific interactions; the temporal overlap with other species determines when they should be active in order to maximize their encounters with food and to minimize their encounters with predators, competitors and parasites. To cope with the constantly changing, but predictable structure of the environment, organisms have evolved internal biological clocks, which are synchronized mainly by light, the most predictable and reliable environmental cue (but which can be masked by other variables), which enable them to anticipate and prepare for predicted changes in the timing of the species they interact with, on top of responding to them directly. Here, we review examples where the internal timing system is used to predict interspecific interactions, and how these interactions affect the internal timing system and activity patterns. We then ask how plastic these mechanisms are, how this plasticity differs between and within species and how this variability in plasticity affects interspecific interactions in a changing world, in which light, the major synchronizer of the biological clock, is no longer a reliable cue owing to the rapidly changing climate, the use of artificial light and urbanization.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wild clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals’.},

A linear discriminant analysis effect size cladogram suggested that ten bacterial OTUs maintain significant differences in relative abundances between LdD and LdN. These results agreed with the discrete ellipses between LdD and LdN in principal coordinates analysis plots. Additionally, using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states, the gut microbial community was assigned to 23 functional terms, among which 22 exhibited significant differences between LdD and LdN.

Motion-activated cameras were used for field-based studies of hawkmoth foraging behaviour on six African plant species. 3. The results showed that short-tongued hawkmoth species forage mainly around dusk and then sporadically throughout the night, whereas long-tongued hawkmoth species feed consistently throughout the night, with a peak shortly before midnight. 4. These results provide the first quantitative estimates of diel patterns of interactions between multiple hawkmoth and plant species and, when combined with qualitative reports from other studies, suggest that differences in diel activity between the two main hawkmoth functional groups (short- and long-tongued) are consistent across the Old and New Worlds.},

However, the methodological advancements in this field have been mostly and sometimes exclusively used only in indoor laboratory settings. In parallel, there has been an unprecedented and rapid improvement in our ability to track animals and their behaviour in the wild. However, while the spatial analysis of tracking data is widespread, its temporal aspect is largely unexplored. Here, we review the tools that are available or have potential to record rhythms in the wild animals with emphasis on currently overlooked approaches and monitoring systems. We then demonstrate, in three question-driven case studies, how the integration of traditional and newer approaches can help answer novel chronobiological questions in free-living animals. Finally, we highlight unresolved issues in field chronobiology that may benefit from technological development in the future. As most of the studies in the field are descriptive, the future challenge lies in applying the diverse technologies to experimental set-ups in the wild.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wild clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals’.},

	abstract = {The interactions between flowering plants and insect pollinators shape ecological communities and provide one of the best examples of coevolution. Although these interactions have received much attention in both ecology and evolution, their temporal aspects are little explored. Here we review studies on the circadian organization of pollination-related traits in bees and flowers. Research, mostly with the honeybee, Apis mellifera, has implicated the circadian clock in key aspects of their foraging for flower rewards. These include anticipation, timing of visits to flowers at specified locations and time-compensated sun-compass orientation. Floral rhythms in traits such as petal opening, scent release and reward availability also show robust daily rhythms. However, in only few studies was it possible to adequately determine whether these oscillations are driven by external time givers such as light and temperature cycles, or endogenous circadian clocks. The interplay between the timing of flower and pollinator rhythms may be ecologically significant. Circadian regulation of pollination-related traits in only few species may influence the entire pollination network and thus affect community structure and local biodiversity. We speculate that these intricate chronobiological interactions may be vulnerable to anthropogenic effects such as the introduction of alien invasive species, pesticides or environmental pollutants.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wild clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals’.},

	abstract = {Most processes within organisms, and most interactions between organisms and their environment, have distinct time profiles. The temporal coordination of such processes is crucial across levels of biological organization, but disciplines differ widely in their approaches to study timing. Such differences are accentuated between ecologists, who are centrally concerned with a holistic view of an organism in relation to its external environment, and chronobiologists, who emphasize internal timekeeping within an organism and the mechanisms of its adjustment to the environment. We argue that ecological and chronobiological perspectives are complementary, and that studies at the intersection will enable both fields to jointly overcome obstacles that currently hinder progress. However, to achieve this integration, we first have to cross some conceptual barriers, clarifying prohibitively inaccessible terminologies. We critically assess main assumptions and concepts in either field, as well as their common interests. Both approaches intersect in their need to understand the extent and regulation of temporal plasticity, and in the concept of ‘chronotype’, i.e. the characteristic temporal properties of individuals which are the targets of natural and sexual selection. We then highlight promising developments, point out open questions, acknowledge difficulties and propose directions for further integration of ecological and chronobiological perspectives through Wild Clock research.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wild Clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals’.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are believed to be an evolutionary adaptation to daily environmental cycles resulting from Earth's rotation about its axis. A trait evolved through a process of natural selection is considered as adaptation; therefore, rigorous demonstration of adaptation requires evidence suggesting evolution of a trait by natural selection. Like any other adaptive trait, circadian rhythms are believed to be advantageous to living beings through some perceived function. Circadian rhythms are thought to confer advantage to their owners through scheduling of biological functions at appropriate time of daily environmental cycle (extrinsic advantage), coordination of internal physiology (intrinsic advantage), and through their role in responses to seasonal changes. So far, the adaptive value of circadian rhythms has been tested in several studies and evidence indeed suggests that they confer advantage to their owners. In this review, we have discussed the background for development of the framework currently used to test the hypothesis of adaptive significance of circadian rhythms. Critical examination of evidence reveals that there are several lacunae in our understanding of circadian rhythms as adaptation. Although it is well known that demonstrating a given trait as adaptation (or setting the necessary criteria) is not a trivial task, here we recommend some of the basic criteria and suggest the nature of evidence required to comprehensively understand circadian rhythms as adaptation. Thus, we hope to create some awareness that may benefit future studies in this direction. (Author correspondence: vsharma@jncasr.ac.in or vksharmas@gmail.com)},

	abstract = {The activity rhythms of marine species may consistently bias demographic evaluation by bottom trawl survey, depending on the time of day. In this study, we examine occurrence data of selected commercial and non-commercial decapod species at different depths (0–800m) of the western Mediterranean as produced by the Mediterranean international trawl survey (MEDITS) UE Program by sampling during daytime. In order to show how the activity rhythms and types of displacement (pelagic, nektobenthic and endobenthic) of different species can alter the occurrences determined by bottom trawling, and to quantify relative bias, we modeled potential outcomes of a putative nocturnal MEDITS sampling. MEDITS and published data for studies with 24-h hauls were compared in order to obtain a folding correction factor. We found that the temporal bias of sampling is moderate when trawling is performed on the continental slope and more important when it occurs on the continental shelf. The configuration of daytime and nighttime occurrence data by depth was performed using non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS). For the daytime configuration, association with irradiance (PAR) was evaluated by fitting occurrence data with a generalized additive model (GAM). Symmetry in species assemblages was found according to depth (inflection point at 200m depth) as a significant irradiance-dependence distribution pattern of occurrences that took place on the shelf, above 200m depth. For the night configuration, the inflection point relaxed due to the active displacements of some species, mixing the assemblages reported in daytime data. Results of the present study indicated that a deep knowledge of the autoecology of decapod species as it relates to activity rhythms (including a precise assessment of displacement typology) is of importance in population distribution and biomass evaluation and also influences locally perceived biodiversity. Accordingly, bottom trawl surveys for population assessment should take into account the timing of sampling as a factor potentially biasing obtained abundances.},

	abstract = {Time as an ecological niche variable or “temporal niche” can be defined in the context of the most prominent environmental cycles, including the tidal cycle, the lunar day and month, the solar day, and the earth year. For the current review, we focus on the 24-h domain generated through the earth's rotation around its axis (solar day). The daily environmental cycles of light and temperature are a dominant ecological factor generating a variety of adaptations among animals. In this review, we describe these adaptations with a special focus on the visual system and on the adaptive plasticity of activity patterns. Our goals are: (1) Underscore the importance of the 24-h time axis as critical variable in the ecological niche. (2) Highlight cases of temporal niche switches at the evolutionary timescale (phylogenetic level). (3) Review temporal niche switching within an individual's lifespan. (4) Evaluate possible underlying mechanisms for temporal niche switching. (5) Describe a new hypothesis of circadian thermoenergetics which may explain several cases of temporal niche switching in mammals. With this, we hope to inspire experiments under natural conditions or more complex laboratory environments, aimed to reveal environmental factors and mechanisms underlying specific temporal programs.},

	abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has long served as a model system for circadian rhythm research. Various aspects of its genetic, molecular, and circuit-level properties are the subject of investigation, based on which several circadian behaviors and their neuronal controls have been unraveled. In an attempt to address the question of functional significance of circadian organization using a comparative approach, we studied activity/rest rhythm of wild-caught D. melanogaster (DM) and its close relative, Drosophila ananassae (DA). We compared features of the rhythm such as the ability to anticipate morning and evening transitions, presence or absence of morning-associated or evening-associated activity peaks, and phase of these peaks in both species. We found that these 2 sympatric species are different from each other in several aspects of activity/rest rhythm. Unlike DM, which showed a distinct bimodal activity pattern with both morning and evening peaks and a midday interval of relative inactivity under a 12:12-h light/dark regime, DA exhibited unimodal activity with a predominant morning peak, restricting most of its activity to the light phase with no apparent “siesta” during midday. While daytime sleep levels were not different between the 2 species, DA exhibited significantly lesser nighttime activity and higher, more consolidated sleep. This predominant morning activity of DA was also reflected in persistence and phasing of the morning peak under a range of photoperiods. Both under long and short days, the morning peak was the most dominant and persistent peak of DA, whereas the evening peak was more dominant in DM. In addition, DA had a significantly faster circadian clock and more consolidated activity compared with DM. Hence, we hypothesize that these recently diverged sympatric species of fruit flies occupy distinct temporal niches due to differences in their underlying circadian clocks and speculate that they occupy different spatial microenvironments in the wild.},

However, directly applying the Faster R-CNN to the small remote sensing objects usually renders poor performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates on how to modify Faster R-CNN for the task of small object detection in optical remote sensing images. First of all, we not only modify the RPN stage of Faster R-CNN by setting appropriate anchors but also leverage a single high-level feature map of a fine resolution by designing a similar architecture adopting top-down and skip connections. In addition, we incorporate context information to further boost small remote sensing object detection performance while we apply a simple sampling strategy to solve the issue about the imbalanced numbers of images between different classes. At last, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation method named \&lsquo;random rotation\&rsquo; during training. Experimental results show that our modified Faster R-CNN algorithm improves the mean average precision by a large margin on detecting small remote sensing objects.},

	abstract = {Recently, the convolutional neural network has brought impressive improvements for object detection. However, detecting tiny objects in large-scale remote sensing images still remains challenging. First, the extreme large input size makes the existing object detection solutions too slow for practical use. Second, the massive and complex backgrounds cause serious false alarms. Moreover, the ultratiny objects increase the difﬁculty of accurate detection. To tackle these problems, we propose a uniﬁed and self-reinforced network called remote sensing region-based convolutional neural network (R2-CNN), composing of backbone Tiny-Net, intermediate global attention block, and ﬁnal classiﬁer and detector. Tiny-Net is a lightweight residual structure, which enables fast and powerful features extraction from inputs. Global attention block is built upon Tiny-Net to inhibit false positives. Classiﬁer is then used to predict the existence of targets in each patch, and detector is followed to locate them accurately if available. The classiﬁer and detector are mutually reinforced with end-to-end training, which further speed up the process and avoid false alarms. Effectiveness of R2-CNN is validated on hundreds of GF-1 images and GF-2 images that are 18 000 × 18 192 pixels, 2.0-m resolution, and 27 620 × 29 200 pixels, 0.8m resolution, respectively. Speciﬁcally, we can process a GF-1 image in 29.4 s on Titian X just with single thread. According to our knowledge, no previous solution can detect the tiny object on such huge remote sensing images gracefully. We believe that it is a signiﬁcant step toward practical real-time remote sensing systems.},

We show that manipulations that impair flight in Drosophila increase sleep as a form of sleep plasticity. We disrupted flight by blocking the wing-expansion program, genetically disrupting flight, and by mechanical wing perturbations. We defined a new sleep regulatory circuit starting with specific wing sensory neurons, their target projection neurons in the ventral nerve cord, and the neurons they connect to in the central brain. In addition, we identified a critical neuropeptide (burs) and its receptor (rickets) that link wing expansion and sleep. Disrupting flight activates these sleep-promoting projection neurons, as indicated by increased cytosolic calcium levels, and stably increases the number of synapses in their axonal projections. These data reveal an unexpected role for flight in regulating sleep and provide new insight into how sensory processing controls sleep need.
We have identified a novel sleep regulatory pathway.

	abstract = {Several evolutionary lineages in the early-divergent angiosperm family Annonaceae possess flowers with a distinctive pollinator trapping mechanism, in which floral phenological events are very precisely timed in relation with pollinator activity patterns. This contrasts with previously described angiosperm pollinator traps, which predominantly function as pitfall traps. We assess the circadian rhythms of pollinators independently of their interactions with flowers, and correlate these data with detailed assessments of floral phenology. We reveal a close temporal alignment between patterns of pollinator activity and the floral phenology driving the trapping mechanism (termed ‘circadian trapping’ here). Non-trapping species with anthesis of standard duration (c. 48 h) cannot be pollinated effectively by pollinators with a morning-unimodal activity pattern; non-trapping species with abbreviated anthesis (23–27 h) face limitations in utilising pollinators with a bimodal circadian activity; whereas species that trap pollinators (all with short anthesis) can utilise a broader range of potential pollinators, including those with both unimodal and bimodal circadian rhythms. In addition to broadening the range of potential pollinators based on their activity patterns, circadian trapping endows other selective advantages, including the possibility of an extended staminate phase to promote pollen deposition, and enhanced interfloral movement of pollinators. The relevance of the alignment of floral phenological changes with peaks in pollinator activity is furthermore evaluated for pitfall trap pollination systems.},

	abstract = {Insect pest management is a very important aspect for plant protection in crops production. Remote sensing provides a large number of techniques that are beneficial in entomological research. Although entomological radars have been used for studying migrations of insects for many years, most of entomological radar studies have been vertically tracing high-altitude migration behaviour of insects. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is a counterpart to radar, now operating in the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which has been recently applied for monitoring of insects at low altitude. Such techniques, in particular low-cost continuous-wave (CW) bi-static systems based on the Scheimpflug arrangement, have been rapidly developing during the last decade. As a result, optical methods present new and fascinating possibilities. Based on experience from a 2-week field campaign in rice paddy fields, we here present an overview of lidar remote sensing applied to the Chinese scene. The capability of a CW Scheimpflug lidar system in monitoring the insects was studied. We present results on insect abundance in relation to time of the day and weather conditions. We also identified insect species by analysing wing-beat frequencies and studied their attraction to ultraviolet (UV) lamp located close to the horizontal laser sampling path during night time. Results showed that the insect species were abundant, that insects detected by the lidar system were attracted to light and that light rain increased the insect activity. The lidar detection system had a high read-out frequency, enabling the estimation of insect wing-beat frequencies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The fruit fly Drosophila suzukii, or spotted wing drosophila (SWD), is a serious pest worldwide, attacking many soft-skinned fruits. An efficient monitoring system that identifies and counts SWD in crops and their surroundings is therefore essential for integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. Existing methods, such as catching flies in liquid bait traps and counting them manually, are costly, time-consuming and labour-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we studied insect trap monitoring using image-based object detection with deep learning. RESULTS Based on an image database with 4753 annotated SWD flies, we trained a ResNet-18-based deep convolutional neural network to detect and count SWD, including sex prediction and discrimination. The results show that SWD can be detected with an area under the precision recall curve (AUC) of 0.506 (female) and 0.603 (male) in digital images taken from a static position. For images collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the algorithm detected SWD individuals with an AUC of 0.086 (female) and 0.284 (male). The lower AUC for the aerial imagery was due to lower image quality caused by stabilisation manoeuvres of the UAV during image collection. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that it is possible to monitor SWD using deep learning and object detection. Moreover, the results demonstrate the potential of UAVs to monitor insect traps, which could be valuable in the development of autonomous insect monitoring systems and IPM.},

The sensor node can be used to simultaneously acquire images of sticky paper traps and measure temperature, humidity, and light intensity levels in a greenhouse. An image processing algorithm was applied to automatically detect and count insect pests on an insect sticky trap with 93\% average temporal detection accuracy compared with manual counting. The integrated monitoring system was implemented with multiple sensor nodes in a greenhouse and experiments were performed to test the system’s performance. Experimental results show that the automatic counting of the monitoring system is comparable with manual counting, and the insect pest count information can be continuously and effectively recorded. Information on insect pest concentrations were further analyzed temporally and spatially with environmental factors. Analyses of experimental data reveal that the normalized hourly increase in the insect pest count appears to be associated with the change in light intensity, temperature, and relative humidity. With the proposed system, laborious manual counting can be circumvented and timely assessment of insect pest and environmental information can be achieved. The system also offers an efficient tool for long-term insect pest behavior observations, as well as for practical applications in integrated pest management (IPM).},

The developed framework comprises an auto label generation module and a deep-learning-based fruit detector ‘LedNet’. The Label Generation algorithm utilises the multi-scale pyramid and clustering classifier to assist fast labelling of training data. LedNet adopts feature pyramid network and atrous spatial pyramid pooling to improve the detection performance of the model. A light-weight backbone is also developed and utilised to improve computational efficiency. From the experimental results, LedNet achieves 0.821 and 0.853 on recall and accuracy on apple detection in orchards, and its weights size and inference time are 7.4 M and 28 ms, respectively. The experimental results show that LedNet can perform real-time apple detection in orchards robustly and efficiently.},

	abstract = {Computer vision is a field that involves making a machine “see”. This technology uses a camera and computer instead of the human eye to identify, track and measure targets for further image processing. With the development of computer vision, such technology has been widely used in the field of agricultural automation and plays a key role in its development. This review systematically summarizes and analyzes the technologies and challenges over the past three years and explores future opportunities and prospects to form the latest reference for researchers. Through the analyses, it is found that the existing technology can help the development of agricultural automation for small field farming to achieve the advantages of low cost, high efficiency and high precision. However, there are still major challenges. First, the technology will continue to expand into new application areas in the future, and there will be more technological issues that need to be overcome. It is essential to build large-scale data sets. Second, with the rapid development of agricultural automation, the demand for professionals will continue to grow. Finally, the robust performance of related technologies in various complex environments will also face challenges. Through analysis and discussion, we believe that in the future, computer vision technology will be combined with intelligent technology such as deep learning technology, be applied to every aspect of agricultural production management based on large-scale datasets, be more widely used to solve the current agricultural problems, and better improve the economic, general and robust performance of agricultural automation systems, thus promoting the development of agricultural automation equipment and systems in a more intelligent direction.},

In Eurasia, they had faced a novel adaptive problem of adjustment of their circadian rhythmicity and night sleep episode to seasonal variation in day length and air temperature. Both species usually respond to heat and a short duration of night by reduction of the amount of night sleep and prolongation of “siesta”. To further explore similarities between the two species in the ways of adjustment of their sleep–wake behavior to extreme environmental factors, this study examined the possibility to distinguish four extreme chronotypes among fruit flies and the possibility of the differential response of such chronotypes to light and heat stressors. Materials and methods: Circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and sleep–wake pattern were tested in constant darkness, and four strains of fruit flies originating from three wild populations of Africa, Europe, and the USA were selected to represent four distinct chronotypes: “larks” (early morning and evening activity peaks), “owls” (late morning and evening peaks), “swifts” (early morning and late evening peaks), and “woodcocks” (late morning and early evening peaks). The circadian rhythms and sleep efficiency of the selected chronotypes were further tested under such extreme conditions as either long day (LD20:4 at 20°C) or a combination of LD20:4 with hot temperature (29°C).  Results: Despite the identity of such experimental conditions for four chronotypes, their circadian rhythms and sleep timing showed significantly distinct patterns of response to exposure to heat and/or long days. All two-way repeated measures analysis of variances yielded a significant interaction between chronotype and time of the day (P},

	abstract = {Seasonal change in daylength (photoperiod) is widely used by insects to regulate temporal patterns of development and behaviour, including the timing of diapause (dormancy) and migration. Flexibility of the photoperiodic response is critical for rapid shifts to new hosts, survival in the face of global climate change and to reproductive isolation. At the same time, the daily circadian clock is also essential for development, diapause and multiple behaviours, including correct flight orientation during long-distance migration. Although studied for decades, how these two critical biological timing mechanisms are integrated is poorly understood, in part because the core circadian clock genes are all transcription factors or regulators that are able to exert multiple effects throughout the genome. In this chapter, we discuss clocks in the wild from the perspective of diverse insect groups across eco-geographic contexts from the Antarctic to the tropical regions of Earth. Application of the expanding tool box of molecular techniques will lead us to distinguish universal from unique mechanisms underlying the evolution of circadian and photoperiodic timing, and their interaction across taxonomic and ecological contexts represented by insects.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wild clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals’.},

	abstract = {The relatively new research discipline of Eco-Metabolomics is the application of metabolomics techniques to ecology with the aim to characterise biochemical interactions of organisms across different spatial and temporal scales. Metabolomics is an untargeted biochemical approach to measure many thousands of metabolites in different species, including plants and animals. Changes in metabolite concentrations can provide mechanistic evidence for biochemical processes that are relevant at ecological scales. These include physiological, phenotypic and morphological responses of plants and communities to environmental changes and also interactions with other organisms. Traditionally, research in biochemistry and ecology comes from two different directions and is performed at distinct spatiotemporal scales. Biochemical studies most often focus on intrinsic processes in individuals at physiological and cellular scales. Generally, they take a bottom-up approach scaling up cellular processes from spatiotemporally fine to coarser scales. Ecological studies usually focus on extrinsic processes acting upon organisms at population and community scales and typically study top-down and bottom-up processes in combination. Eco-Metabolomics is a transdisciplinary research discipline that links biochemistry and ecology and connects the distinct spatiotemporal scales. In this review, we focus on approaches to study chemical and biochemical interactions of plants at various ecological levels, mainly plant\&ndash;organismal interactions, and discuss related examples from other domains. We present recent developments and highlight advancements in Eco-Metabolomics over the last decade from various angles. We further address the five key challenges: (1) complex experimental designs and large variation of metabolite profiles; (2) feature extraction; (3) metabolite identification; (4) statistical analyses; and (5) bioinformatics software tools and workflows. The presented solutions to these challenges will advance connecting the distinct spatiotemporal scales and bridging biochemistry and ecology.},

This effect is associated with circadian fluctuations in levels of jasmonic acid, the transcription factor MYC2, and glucosinolate contents in leaves. We tested whether a similar effect could be observed in a different plant–herbivore system: the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and its co-evolved specialist herbivore, Manduca sexta. We measured larval growth on plants under both constant and diurnal conditions following identical or opposite entrainment, profiled the metabolome of attacked leaf tissue, quantified specific metabolites known to reduce M. sexta growth, and monitored M. sexta feeding activity under all experimental conditions. Entrainment did not consistently affect M. sexta growth or plant defense induction. However, both were reduced under constant dark conditions, as was M. sexta feeding activity. Our data indicate that the response induced by M. sexta in N. attenuata is robust to diurnal cues and independent of plant or herbivore entrainment. We propose that while the patterns of constitutive or general damage-induced defense may undergo circadian fluctuation, the orchestration of specific induced responses is more complex.},

	abstract = {As sessile, photosynthetic organisms, plants benefit greatly from a circadian clock that adjusts their overall metabolism in anticipation of the highly predictable arrival of sunrise and sunset. Thus, it is not surprising that about one-third of all plant genes show evidence of circadian regulation in their expression patterns (1, 2). However, closer examination of this diurnally regulated transcription shows that it comprises not only the predictable genes involved in photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, and water uptake but numerous genes with known functions in plant defense. Recent studies show that the success of pathogen infections is influenced by the plant circadian clock (3⇓–5). Accumulation of salicylic acid, a key signal for the induction of antimicrobial defenses, peaks at night and may lead to elevated pathogen resistance in the early morning. Cyclical accumulation of herbivore-induced plant metabolites (6), as well as reciprocal effects of plant secondary metabolism on the circadian clock (7), suggests that resistance to insect herbivory also should show diurnal regulation. This hypothesis is confirmed by a study in PNAS (8), which provides a previously undescribed avenue for studying plant-herbivore interactions by demonstrating that plants can benefit from synchrony in the pattern of diurnally regulated defenses and insect feeding behavior.

The report by Goodspeed et al. (8) is focused on laboratory studies of interactions between the generalist lepidopteran herbivore Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) and the small cruciferous plant Arabidopsis thaliana ( Arabidopsis ) (Fig. 1 A ).

Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) are emitted by plants upon damage but can be suppressed by herbivore-associated elicitors, and the abundance and composition of GLVs vary depending on the timing of herbivore attack. We show that the GLV biosynthetic enzyme HYDROPEROXIDE LYASE (HPL) is transcriptionally regulated by the circadian clock in Nicotiana attenuata. In accordance with transcript abundance of NaHPL, GLV aldehyde pools in intact leaves peaked at night and at subjective night under diurnal and continuous light conditions, respectively. Moreover, although the basal abundance of NaHPL transcripts is upregulated by jasmonate (JA) signaling, JA does not regulate the reduction of NaHPL transcript abundance in damaged leaves by simulated herbivore treatment. Unexpectedly, the plant circadian clock was strongly altered when Manduca sexta larvae fed on N. attenuata, and this was also independent of JA signaling. Lastly, the temporal dynamics of NaHPL transcripts and total GLV emissions were strongly altered by M. sexta larval feeding. Our data suggest that the temporal dynamics of emitted GLV blends result from a combination of damage, JA signaling, herbivore-associated elicitors, and the plant circadian clock.},

	abstract = {Plants have evolved robust mechanisms to perceive and respond to diverse environmental stimuli. The plant phytohormones jasmonates and salicylates play key roles in activating biotic stress response pathways. Recent findings demonstrate that basal levels of both jasmonates and salicylates in Arabidopsis are under the control of the circadian clock and that clock-controlled jasmonate accumulation may underlie clock- and jasmonate-dependent enhanced resistance of Arabidopsis to Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper), a generalist herbivore. Here we summarize these findings and provide further evidence that a functional plant circadian clock is required for optimal herbivore defense in Arabidopsis. When given a choice to feed on wild-type plants or arrhythmic transgenics, T. ni prefer plants lacking robust circadian rhythms. Altogether these data provide strong evidence for circadian clock enabling anticipation of herbivore attack and thus contributing to overall plant fitness.},

Here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the circadian regulation of physiology and behavior in mammals. We also review recent efforts to understand circadian flexibility, such as how the phase of activity and rest is altered depending on the encountered environment. We explain why shifting activity to the day is an adaptive strategy to cope with energetic challenges and show how this can reduce thermoregulatory costs. A framework is provided to make predictions about the optimal timing of activity and rest of non-model species for a wide range of habitats. This Review illustrates how the timing of daily rhythms is reciprocally linked to energy homeostasis, and it highlights the importance of this link in understanding daily rhythms in physiology and behavior.},

	abstract = {The diversity–stability relationship has been under intense scrutiny for the past decades, and temporal asynchrony is recognized as an important aspect of ecosystem stability. In contrast to relatively well-studied interannual and seasonal asynchrony, few studies investigate the role of circadian cycles for ecosystem stability. Here, we studied multifunctional redundancy of diurnal and nocturnal ant communities in four tropical rain forest sites. We analyzed how it was influenced by species richness, functional performance, and circadian asynchrony. In two neotropical sites, species richness and functional redundancy were lower at night. In contrast, these parameters did not differ in the two paleotropical sites we studied. Circadian asynchrony between species was pronounced in the neotropical sites, and increased circadian functional redundancy. In general, species richness positively affected functional redundancy, but the effect size depended on the temporal and spatial breadth of the species with highest functional performance. Our analysis shows that high levels of trophic performance were only reached through the presence of such high-performing species, but not by even contributions of multiple, less-efficient species. Thus, these species can increase current functional performance, but reduce overall functional redundancy. Our study highlights that diurnal and nocturnal ecosystem properties of the very same habitat can markedly differ in terms of species richness and functional redundancy. Consequently, like the need to study multiple ecosystem functions, multiple periods of the circadian cycle need to be assessed in order to fully understand the diversity–stability relationship in an ecosystem.},

This has led to a situation in which mistakes are less likely to be made than before, but are equally likely to be absurd or catastrophic when they do occur. Past works have recognised and tried to address this issue of mistake severity, often by using graph distances in class hierarchies, but this has largely been neglected since the advent of the current deep learning era in computer vision. In this paper, we aim to renew interest in this problem by reviewing past approaches and proposing two simple modifications of the cross-entropy loss which outperform the prior art under several metrics on two large datasets with complex class hierarchies: tieredImageNet and iNaturalist19.},

	abstract = {Failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper should be worse and penalized more than failing to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle; after all, sheepdogs and poodles are both breeds of dogs. However, existing metrics of failure (so-called "loss" or "win") used in textual or visual classification/recognition via neural networks seldom leverage a-priori information, such as a sheepdog being more similar to a poodle than to a skyscraper. We define a metric that, inter alia, can penalize failure to distinguish between a sheepdog and a skyscraper more than failure to distinguish between a sheepdog and a poodle. Unlike previously employed possibilities, this metric is based on an ultrametric tree associated with any given tree organization into a semantically meaningful hierarchy of a classifier's classes. An ultrametric tree is a tree with a so-called ultrametric distance metric such that all leaves are at the same distance from the root. Unfortunately, extensive numerical experiments indicate that the standard practice of training neural networks via stochastic gradient descent with random starting points often drives down the hierarchical loss nearly as much when minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss as when trying to minimize the hierarchical loss directly. Thus, this hierarchical loss is unreliable as an objective for plain, randomly started stochastic gradient descent to minimize; the main value of the hierarchical loss may be merely as a meaningful metric of success of a classifier.},

	abstract = {In classification tasks, an object usually belongs to one class within a set of disjoint classes. In more complex tasks, an object can belong to more than one class, in what is conventionally termed multi-label classification. Moreover, there are cases in which the set of classes are organised in a hierarchical fashion, and an object must be associated to a single path in this hierarchy, defining the so-called hierarchical classification. Finally, in even more complex scenarios, the classes are organised in a hierarchical structure and the object can be associated to multiple paths of this hierarchy, defining the problem investigated in this article: hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC). We address a typical problem of HMC, which is protein function prediction, and for that we propose an approach that chains multiple neural networks, performing both local and global optimisation in order to provide the final prediction: one or multiple paths in the hierarchy of classes. We experiment with four variations of this chaining process, and we compare these strategies with the state-of-the-art HMC algorithms for protein function prediction, showing that our novel approach significantly outperforms these methods.},

	abstract = {Background: Convolutional Neural Networks can be eﬀectively used only when data are endowed with an intrinsic concept of neighbourhood in the input space, as is the case of pixels in images. We introduce here Ph-CNN, a novel deep learning architecture for the classiﬁcation of metagenomics data based on the Convolutional Neural Networks, with the patristic distance deﬁned on the phylogenetic tree being used as the proximity measure. The patristic distance between variables is used together with a sparsiﬁed version of MultiDimensional Scaling to embed the phylogenetic tree in a Euclidean space.
Results: Ph-CNN is tested with a domain adaptation approach on synthetic data and on a metagenomics collection of gut microbiota of 38 healthy subjects and 222 Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease patients, divided in 6 subclasses. Classiﬁcation performance is promising when compared to classical algorithms like Support Vector Machines and Random Forest and a baseline fully connected neural network, e.g. the Multi-Layer Perceptron.
Conclusion: Ph-CNN represents a novel deep learning approach for the classiﬁcation of metagenomics data. Operatively, the algorithm has been implemented as a custom Keras layer taking care of passing to the following convolutional layer not only the data but also the ranked list of neighbourhood of each sample, thus mimicking the case of image data, transparently to the user.},

In this paper, we present a simple method to classify and count beetles in noisy trap images. The proposed method uses the beetles' body size and spots made by the light reflecting off the backs of beetles. We verify the method using images of beetles attached to the insect trap. The results demonstrate that the number of individuals in each species as counted by the proposed method and the manually counted number are statistically identical, which means that our method is sufficient to replace the existing manual counting method.

We implemented a computational model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from mosquito images to identify adult mosquitoes from the species Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. To train the CNN to perform automatic morphological classification of mosquitoes, we used a dataset that included 4,056 mosquito images. Three neural networks, including LeNet, AlexNet and GoogleNet, were used. During the validation phase, the accuracy of the mosquito classification was 57.5\% using LeNet, 74.7\% using AlexNet and 83.9\% using GoogleNet. During the testing phase, the best result (76.2\%) was obtained using GoogleNet; results of 52.4\% and 51.2\% were obtained using LeNet and AlexNet, respectively. Significantly, accuracies of 100\% and 90\% were achieved for the classification of Aedes and Culex, respectively. A classification accuracy of 82\% was achieved for Aedes females. Our results provide information that is fundamental for the automatic morphological classification of adult mosquito species in field. The use of CNN's is an important method for autonomous identification and is a valuable and accessible resource for health workers and taxonomists for the identification of some insects that can transmit infectious agents to humans.},

Capture frequencies over 2-h intervals, obtained via live trapping (6850 trap-nights) in chosen months over 3 y formed the empirical basis for analyses. Trap transects were set from 19h00 to 07h00 and checked every 2 h. Analyses of 484 captures evinced two distinct assemblages. The TSF assemblage was diverse and with non-random temporal niche segregation, whereas the CF assemblage was depauperate with its two dominant species evincing the same activity pattern. Predator avoidance between open- and closed-microhabitat species, as well as niche complementarity may explain temporal segregation at TSF. This is the first documentation of assemblage-wide non-random temporal segregation of neotropical rodents. Time of activity may be a largely under-appreciated mechanism in other species-rich tropical rodent assemblages as well as in other species-rich biotas.},

	abstract = {We introduce a device for the automatic detecting and reporting of crawling insects in urban environments. It is a monitoring device for urban pests that complies with the context of smart homes and smart cities, and is compatible with the emerging discipline of the Internet of Things (IoT). We believe it can find its place in every room of a hotel, hospital, military camp, and residence. This box-shaped device attracts targeted insect pests, senses the entering insect, and takes automatically a picture of the internal space of the box. The e-trap includes strong attractants (pheromone and/or food) to increase capture efficiency and traps the insect on its sticky floor. The device carries the necessary optoelectronic sensors to monitor all entrances of the trap. As the insect enters it interrupts the infrared light source. This triggers a detection event; a picture is taken, and a time-stamp is set before delivering the picture through the Wi-Fi to an authorized person/stakeholder. The device can be integrated seamlessly in urban environments and operates unobtrusively to human activities. We report results on various insect pests and depending on the insect species, can reach a detection accuracy ranging from 96 to 99\%.},

	abstract = {Organisms are believed to have evolved circadian clocks as adaptations to deal with cyclic environmental changes, and therefore it has been hypothesized that evolution in constant environments would lead to regression of such clocks. However, previous studies have yielded mixed results, and evolution of circadian clocks under constant conditions has remained an unsettled topic of debate in circadian biology. In continuation of our previous studies, which reported persistence of circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster populations evolving under constant light, here we intended to examine whether circadian clocks and the associated properties evolve differently under constant light and constant darkness. In this regard, we assayed activity-rest, adult emergence and oviposition rhythms of D. melanogaster populations which have been maintained for over 19 years ( 330 generations) under three different light regimes – constant light (LL), light–dark cycles of 12:12 h (LD) and constant darkness (DD). We observed that while circadian rhythms in all the three behaviors persist in both LL and DD stocks with no differences in circadian period, they differed in certain aspects of the entrained rhythms when compared to controls reared in rhythmic environment (LD). Interestingly, we also observed that DD stocks have evolved significantly higher robustness or power of free-running activity-rest and adult emergence rhythms compared to LL stocks. Thus, our study, in addition to corroborating previous results of circadian clock evolution in constant light, also highlights that, contrary to the expected regression of circadian clocks, rearing in constant darkness leads to the evolution of more robust circadian clocks which may be attributed to an intrinsic adaptive advantage of circadian clocks and/or pleiotropic functions of clock genes in other traits.},

Although these studies have served the purpose of providing a broad framework for our understanding of regulation of rhythmic behaviors under cyclic conditions, they do not reveal how organisms keep time in nature. Although a few recent studies have attempted to address this, it is not yet clear which environmental factors regulate rhythmic behaviors in nature and how. Here, we report the results of our studies aimed at examining (i) whether and how changes in natural light affect activity/rest rhythm and (ii) what the functional significance of this rhythmic behavior might be. We found that wild-type strains of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, display morning (M), afternoon (A), and evening (E) peaks of activity under seminatural conditions (SN), whereas under constant darkness in otherwise SN, they exhibited M and E peaks, and under constant light in SN, only the E peak occurred. Unlike the A peak, which requires exposure to bright light in the afternoon, light information is dispensable for the M and E peaks. Visual examination of behaviors suggests that the M peak is associated with courtship-related locomotor activity and the A peak is due to an artifact of the experimental protocol and largely circadian clock independent.},

Traditional manual identification and counting of flying insects is labor intensive and inefficient. In this study, a vision-based counting and classification system for flying insects is designed and implemented. The system is constructed as follows: firstly, a yellow sticky trap is installed in the surveillance area to trap flying insects and a camera is set up to collect real-time images. Then the detection and coarse counting method based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection, the classification method and fine counting based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) using global features are designed. Finally, the insect counting and recognition system is implemented on Raspberry PI. Six species of flying insects including bee, fly, mosquito, moth, chafer and fruit fly are selected to assess the effectiveness of the system. Compared with the conventional methods, the test results show promising performance. The average counting accuracy is 92.50\% and average classifying accuracy is 90.18\% on Raspberry PI. The proposed system is easy-to-use and provides efficient and accurate recognition data, therefore, it can be used for intelligent agriculture applications.},

	abstract = {Τhe concept of remote insect surveillance at large spatial scales for many serious insect pests of agricultural and medical importance has been introduced in a series of our papers. We augment typical, low-cost plastic traps for many insect pests with the necessary optoelectronic sensors to guard the entrance of the trap to detect, time-stamp, GPS tag, and—in relevant cases—identify the species of the incoming insect from their wingbeat. For every important crop pest, there are monitoring protocols to be followed to decide when to initiate a treatment procedure before a serious infestation occurs. Monitoring protocols are mainly based on specifically designed insect traps. Traditional insect monitoring suffers in that the scope of such monitoring: is curtailed by its cost, requires intensive labor, is time consuming, and an expert is often needed for sufficient accuracy which can sometimes raise safety issues for humans. These disadvantages reduce the extent to which manual insect monitoring is applied and therefore its accuracy, which finally results in significant crop loss due to damage caused by pests. With the term ‘surveillance’ we intend to push the monitoring idea to unprecedented levels of information extraction regarding the presence, time-stamping detection events, species identification, and population density of targeted insect pests. Insect counts, as well as environmental parameters that correlate with insects’ population development, are wirelessly transmitted to the central monitoring agency in real time and are visualized and streamed to statistical methods to assist enforcement of security control to insect pests. In this work, we emphasize how the traps can be self-organized in networks that collectively report data at local, regional, country, continental, and global scales using the emerging technology of the Internet of Things (IoT). This research is necessarily interdisciplinary and falls at the intersection of entomology, optoelectronic engineering, data-science, and crop science and encompasses the design and implementation of low-cost, low-power technology to help reduce the extent of quantitative and qualitative crop losses by many of the most significant agricultural pests. We argue that smart traps communicating through IoT to report in real-time the level of the pest population from the field straight to a human controlled agency can, in the very near future, have a profound impact on the decision-making process in crop protection and will be disruptive of existing manual practices. In the present study, three cases are investigated: monitoring Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) using (a) Picusan and (b) Lindgren trap; and (c) monitoring various stored grain beetle pests using the stored-grain pitfall trap. Our approach is very accurate, reaching 98–99\% accuracy on automatic counts compared with real detected numbers of insects in each type of trap.},

Given this, the last sixty years have seen many research efforts on this task. To date, however, none of this research has had a lasting impact. In this work, we explain this lack of progress. We attribute the stagnation on this problem to several factors, including the use of acoustic sensing devices, the overreliance on the single feature of wingbeat frequency, and the attempts to learn complex models with relatively little data. In contrast, we show that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce vastly superior data, that we can exploit additional features, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect’s flight behavior, and that a Bayesian classification approach allows us to efficiently learn classification models that are very robust to overfitting. We demonstrate our findings with large scale experiments, as measured both by the number of insects and the number of species considered.},

Brown Planthopper (BPH) causes high levels of economic loss in Malaysia.

Automated detection of BPH has been proposed by many studies to overcome human fallibility. However, all studies regarding automated recognition of BPH are investigated based on intact specimen although most of the specimens are imperfect, with missing parts have distorted shapes. The automated recognition of an imperfect insect image is more difficult than recognition of the intact specimen. This study proposes an automated, deep-learning-based detection pipeline, PENYEK, to identify BPH pest in images taken from a readily available sticky pad, constructed by clipping plastic sheets onto steel plates and spraying with glue. This study explores the effectiveness of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, VGG16, in classifying insects as BPH or benign based on grayscale images constructed from Euclidean Distance Maps (EDM). The pipeline identified imperfect images of BPH with an accuracy of 95\% using deep-learning’s hyperparameters: softmax, a mini-batch of 30 and an initial learning rate of 0.0001.},

In this review, we link mechanisms, adaptation, and population dynamics within a single conceptual framework, needed for a full understanding of the causes and consequences of this synchrony. The physiological mechanisms underlying herbivore and plant phenology are affected by environmental cues, such as photoperiod and temperature, although not necessarily in the same way. That these different mechanisms lead to synchrony, even if there is spatial and temporal variation in plant phenology, is a result of the strong natural selection acting on the mechanism underlying herbivore phenology. Synchrony has a major impact on the population densities of leaf-feeding Lepidoptera, and years with a high synchrony may lead to outbreaks. Global climate change leads to a disruption of the synchrony between herbivores and their host plants, which may have major impacts for population viability if natural selection is insufficient to restore synchrony.},

The outstanding question is whether these responses match the temperature-induced shift of the selection pressures acting on these organisms. Organisms have evolved response mechanisms that are only adaptive given the existing relationship between the cues organisms use and the selection pressures acting on them. Global warming may disrupt ecosystem interactions because it alters these relationships and micro-evolution may be slow in tracking these changes. In particular, such shifts have serious consequences for ecosystem functioning for the tight multitrophic interactions involved in the timing of reproduction and growth. We determined the response of winter moth (Operophtera brumata) egg hatching and oak (Quercus robur) bud burst to temperature, a system with strong selection on synchronization. We show that there has been poor synchrony in recent warm springs, which is due to an increase in spring temperatures without a decrease in the incidence of freezing spells in winter. This is a clear warning that such changes in temperature patterns may affect ecosystem interactions more strongly than changes in mean temperature.},

	abstract = {Warmer springs advance many phenological events, including flowering time in plants and the flight time of insects [1]. Pollination by insects, an ecosystem service of immense economic and conservation importance [2], depends on synchrony between insect activity and flowering time. If plants and their pollinators show different phenological responses to climate warming, pollination could fail. Information about the effects of warming on specific plant-insect mutualisms is difficult to obtain from complex pollination networks [3]. In contrast, the extraordinarily specific deceptions evolved by orchids [4] that attract a very narrow range of pollinators allow direct examination of the potential for climatic warming to disrupt synchrony. Here we show that a sexually deceptive orchid and the solitary bee on which it depends for pollination will diverge in phenology with increasing spring temperature. Male bees inadvertently pollinate the orchid flowers during pseudocopulation. Analysis of museum specimens (1893–2007) and recent field-based records (1975–2009) showed that flight date of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea is advanced more by higher temperatures than is flowering date in the deceptive orchid Ophrys sphegodes. Male bees emerged slightly earlier than females, which attract male copulatory attentions away from the deceptive flowers. Warming by as little as 2°C increased both the probability of male flight and the proportion of females flying in the bee population before orchid flowering; this would reduce the frequency of pseudocopulation and thus lower pollination success rate in the orchid. Our results demonstrate a significant potential for coevolved plant-pollinator relationships to be disrupted by climatic warming.},

	abstract = {1. Herbivores consume a large portion of the biomass produced by plants in virtually all ecosystems, which has dramatic effects on both the ecology and evolution of plants. In response to this threat, plants have evolved a diverse arsenal of direct and indirect defences to reduce herbivory and the impacts of damage on plant performance. 2. This special feature is a broad synthesis of the evolution and ecology of plant defences. The first objective of this special feature is to provide a review of what we have learned about plant defences against herbivores. The second objective is to stimulate debate and sow fresh ideas for the future research. 3. The 11 articles in this issue address three fundamental questions: (i) How do plants defend themselves against a diverse array of enemies? (ii) Why do plant species vary in defence? And (iii) What are the ecological and ecosystem-level consequences of plant defence? In addressing these questions the articles cover the interdisciplinary nature of plant–herbivore evolutionary ecology, from genes to global patterns. 4. The articles contained in the special feature question existing paradigms and provide new analyses of data. In some cases, influential hypotheses are firmly supported with new analyses (e.g. the Resource Availability Hypothesis), whereas in other instances conventional wisdom is called into question (e.g. the importance of secondary metabolites in the microevolution of resistance) and popular hypotheses are rejected (e.g. the Apparency Hypothesis, the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis). 5. This is an exciting time for research on the evolutionary ecology of plant defences. The articles in this special feature provide a guide to how we can move forward in resolving existing problems and tackling new questions.},

Cross-talk between the circadian clock and a diverse range of physiological processes in plants, including stress acclimatization, hormone signalling, photomorphogenesis and defence signalling, is currently being explored. Recent studies on circadian clock genes and genes involved in defence signalling have indicated a possible reciprocal interaction between the two. It has been proposed that the circadian clock shapes the outcome of plant–pathogen interactions. In this review, we highlight the studies carried out so far on two model plant pathogens, namely Pseudomonas syringae and Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, and the involvement of the circadian clock in gating effector-triggered immunity and pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity. We focus on how the circadian clock gates the expression of various stress-related transcripts in a prolific manner to enhance plant fitness. An understanding of this dynamic relationship between clock and stress will open up new avenues in the understanding of endogenous mechanisms of defence signalling in plants.},

	abstract = {Plants respond to herbivore attack by launching two types of defenses: direct defense and indirect defense. Direct defense includes all plant traits that increase the resistance of host plants to insect herbivores by affecting the physiology and/or behavior of the attackers. Indirect defense includes all traits that by themselves do not have significant direct impact on the attacking herbivores, but can attract natural enemies of the herbivores and thus reduce plant loss. When plants recognize herbivore-associated elicitors, they produce and release a blend of volatiles that can attract predators, parasites, and other natural enemies. Known herbivore-associated elicitors include fatty acid-amino acid conjugates, sulfur-containing fatty acids, fragments of cell walls, peptides, esters, and enzymes. Identified plant volatiles include terpenes, nitrogenous compounds, and indoles. In addition, constitive traits including extrafloral nectars, food bodies, and domatia can be further induced to higher levels and attract natural enemies as well as provide food and shelter to carnivores. A better understanding of indirect plant defense at global and componential levels via advanced high throughput technologies may lead to utilization of indirect defense in suppression of herbivore damage to plants.

	abstract = {Diverse life forms have evolved internal clocks enabling them to monitor time and thereby anticipate the daily environmental changes caused by Earth's rotation. The plant circadian clock regulates expression of about one-third of the Arabidopsis genome, yet the physiological relevance of this regulation is not fully understood. Here we show that the circadian clock, acting with hormone signals, provides selective advantage to plants through anticipation of and enhanced defense against herbivory. We found that cabbage loopers (Trichoplusia ni) display rhythmic feeding behavior that is sustained under constant conditions, and plants entrained in light/dark cycles coincident with the entrainment of the T. ni suffer only moderate tissue loss due to herbivory. In contrast, plants entrained out-of-phase relative to the insects are significantly more susceptible to attack. The in-phase entrainment advantage is lost in plants with arrhythmic clocks or deficient in jasmonate hormone; thus, both the circadian clock and jasmonates are required. Circadian jasmonate accumulation occurs in a phase pattern consistent with preparation for the onset of peak circadian insect feeding behavior, providing evidence for the underlying mechanism of clock-enhanced herbivory resistance. Furthermore, we find that salicylate, a hormone involved in biotrophic defense that often acts antagonistically to jasmonates, accumulates in opposite phase to jasmonates. Our results demonstrate that the plant circadian clock provides a strong physiological advantage by performing a critical role in Arabidopsis defense.},

	abstract = {Insect populations are changing rapidly, and monitoring these changes is essential for understanding the causes and consequences of such shifts. However, large-scale insect identification projects are time-consuming and expensive when done solely by human identifiers. Machine learning offers a possible solution to help collect insect data quickly and efficiently. Here, we outline a methodology for training classification models to identify pitfall trap-collected insects from image data and then apply the method to identify ground beetles (Carabidae). All beetles were collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a continental scale ecological monitoring project with sites across the United States. We describe the procedures for image collection, image data extraction, data preparation, and model training, and compare the performance of five machine learning algorithms and two classification methods (hierarchical vs. single-level) identifying ground beetles from the species to subfamily level. All models were trained using pre-extracted feature vectors, not raw image data. Our methodology allows for data to be extracted from multiple individuals within the same image thus enhancing time efficiency, utilizes relatively simple models that allow for direct assessment of model performance, and can be performed on relatively small datasets. The best performing algorithm, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), reached an accuracy of 84.6\% at the species level when naively identifying species, which was further increased to {\textgreater}95\% when classifications were limited by known local species pools. Model performance was negatively correlated with taxonomic specificity, with the LDA model reaching an accuracy of 99\% at the subfamily level. When classifying carabid species not included in the training dataset at higher taxonomic levels species, the models performed significantly better than if classifications were made randomly. We also observed greater performance when classifications were made using the hierarchical classification method compared to the single-level classification method at higher taxonomic levels. The general methodology outlined here serves as a proof-of-concept for classifying pitfall trap-collected organisms using machine learning algorithms, and the image data extraction methodology may be used for nonmachine learning uses. We propose that integration of machine learning in large-scale identification pipelines will increase efficiency and lead to a greater flow of insect macroecological data, with the potential to be expanded for use with other noninsect taxa.},

Variation in the level and rhythm of daily activity in a population could also affect population performance by directly altering ecological, social, and sexual interactions among individuals. However, it remains to be elucidated whether such intra-population variation in the level and rhythms of daily activity exists in a natural population. Here, we investigated the genetic variation in daily activity within a single natural population of Drosophila immigrans. We established 21 isofemale lines from a single natural population and measured larval activity level and the level and daily pattern of adult activity over a 24 hr period. Larval activity level significantly varied among isofemale lines. Likewise, the activity level in the adult stage significantly varied among lines. The significant variation was also found in the daily pattern of adult activity; some lines showed greater activity level in the daytime, and others showed greater activity level in the night. Our results consistently suggest that there is a genetic variation in behavioral activity in a natural population, probably contributing to shaping the population performance.},

	abstract = {Honey bees are critical pollinators in ecosystems and agriculture, but their numbers have significantly declined. Declines in pollinator populations are thought to be due to multiple factors including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to disease and parasites, and pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are agonists of insect nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and sub-lethal exposures are linked to reduced honey bee hive survival. Honey bees are highly dependent on circadian clocks to regulate critical behaviors, such as foraging orientation and navigation, time-memory for food sources, sleep, and learning/memory processes. Because circadian clock neurons in insects receive light input through cholinergic signaling we tested for effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep. Neonicotinoid ingestion by feeding over several days results in neonicotinoid accumulation in the bee brain, disrupts circadian rhythmicity in many individual bees, shifts the timing of behavioral circadian rhythms in bees that remain rhythmic, and impairs sleep. Neonicotinoids and light input act synergistically to disrupt bee circadian behavior, and neonicotinoids directly stimulate wake-promoting clock neurons in the fruit fly brain. Neonicotinoids disrupt honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep, likely by aberrant stimulation of clock neurons, to potentially impair honey bee navigation, time-memory, and social communication.},

	abstract = {Nature is under siege. In the last 10,000 y the human population has grown from 1 million to 7.8 billion. Much of Earth’s arable lands are already in agriculture (1), millions of acres of tropical forest are cleared each year (2, 3), atmospheric CO2 levels are at their highest concentrations in more than 3 million y (4), and climates are erratically and steadily changing from pole to pole, triggering unprecedented droughts, fires, and floods across continents. Indeed, most biologists agree that the world has entered its sixth mass extinction event, the first since the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million y ago, when more than 80\% of all species, including the nonavian dinosaurs, perished.

Ongoing losses have been clearly demonstrated for better-studied groups of organisms. Terrestrial vertebrate population sizes and ranges have contracted by one-third, and many mammals have experienced range declines of at least 80\% over the last century (5). A 2019 assessment suggests that half of all amphibians are imperiled (2.5\% of which have recently gone extinct) (6). Bird numbers across North America have fallen by 2.9 billion since 1970 (7). Prospects for the world’s coral reefs, beyond the middle of this century, could scarcely be more dire (8). A 2020 United Nations report estimated that more than a million species are in danger of extinction over the next few decades (9), but also see the more bridled assessments in refs. 10 and 11.

Although a flurry of reports has drawn attention to declines in insect abundance, biomass, species richness, and range sizes (e.g., refs. 12⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–18; for reviews see refs. 19 and 20), whether the rates of declines for insects are on par with or exceed those for other groups remains unknown.

The theoretical section also provided a general background to biological rhythms and biological clocks (Chap. 2). The other main section of the book surveyed our current knowledge of activity patterns in various small mammal groups as based on empirical findings. In this concluding chapter we, as the editors, want to provide a synthesis of the information presented in the previous 14 chapters. In doing so we will try to concentrate on the general features in — and behind — the various approaches to activity patterns by a comparison among small mammal species. We would like this synthesis to serve as a baseline to clarify where we are and to point towards future developments — for better understanding, and to address new challenges.},

As the human population grows, there are fewer places for animals to live out their lives independently of our influence. Given our mostly diurnal tendencies, one domain that remains less affected by humans is the night. Gaynor et al. found that across the globe and across mammalian species—from deer to coyotes and from tigers to wild boar—animals are becoming more nocturnal (see the Perspective by Benítez-López). Human activities of all kinds, including nonlethal pastimes such as hiking, seem to drive animals to make use of hours when we are not around. Such changes may provide some relief, but they may also have ecosystem-level consequences.
Science, this issue p. 1232; see also p. 1185
Rapid expansion of human activity has driven well-documented shifts in the spatial distribution of wildlife, but the cumulative effect of human disturbance on the temporal dynamics of animals has not been quantified. We examined anthropogenic effects on mammal diel activity patterns, conducting a meta-analysis of 76 studies of 62 species from six continents. Our global study revealed a strong effect of humans on daily patterns of wildlife activity. Animals increased their nocturnality by an average factor of 1.36 in response to human disturbance. This finding was consistent across continents, habitats, taxa, and human activities. As the global human footprint expands, temporal avoidance of humans may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence. However, such responses can result in marked shifts away from natural patterns of activity, with consequences for fitness, population persistence, community interactions, and evolution.
Human activities are pushing animals towards a more nocturnal existence.

Observations about splattered bugs don't count as scientific, of course, but remarkably few reliable data exist on the fate of these important species. Scientists have tracked alarming declines in domesticated honey bees, monarch butterflies, and lightning bugs. But few have paid attention to the moths, hover flies, beetles, and countless other insects that buzz and flitter through the warm months. Of the scant records that do exist, many come from amateur naturalists, whether butterfly collectors or bird watchers. Now, a new set of long-term data is coming to light, this time from a dedicated group of mostly amateur entomologists who have tracked insect abundance at hundreds of nature reserves across western Europe for more than 30 years. Over that time, the group, the Krefeld Entomological Society, has seen the expected ups and downs in the yearly insect catches. But in 2013 they spotted something alarming. When they returned to one of their earliest trapping sites from 1989, they found that the total mass of their catch had fallen by nearly 80\%. Perhaps it was a particularly bad year, they thought, so they set up the traps again in 2014. The numbers were just as low. The group, which had carefully saved thousands of samples over 3 decades, did more direct comparisons. They found dramatic declines across more than a dozen other sites. Their observations raise questions about how widespread such losses are, and what might be the cause.
Surveys in German nature reserves point to a dramatic decline in insect biomass. Key members of ecosystems may be slipping away.

Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

	abstract = {The importance of sympatric speciation – the evolution of reproductive isolation between codistributed conspecific individuals – in generating biodiversity is highly controversial. Allochrony, or differences in breeding time (phenology) between conspecific individuals, has the potential to lead to reproductive isolation and therefore speciation. We critically review the literature to test the importance of allochronic speciation over the three timescales over which allochrony can occur – over the day, between seasons or between years – and explore what is known about genomic mechanisms underlying allochrony in the diverse taxa in which it is found. We found that allochrony can be a key contributor to reproductive isolation, especially if populations have little overlap in breeding time and therefore little potential for gene flow, and may sometimes be the initial or key driver of speciation. Shifts in phenology can be caused by several factors, including a new ecological opportunity, environmental change, or reinforcement. The underlying genomic basis of allochrony has been studied mostly in insects, highlighting the need for genomic studies in other taxa; nonetheless, results to date indicate that several cases of allochrony involve changes in circadian genes. This review provides the first comprehensive discussion of the role of allochrony in speciation and demonstrates that allochrony as a contributor to divergence may be more widespread than previously thought. Understanding genomic changes and adaptations allowing organisms to breed at new times may be key in the light of phenological changes required under climate change.},

	abstract = {The mammalian circadian system synchronizes daily timing of activity and rest with the environmental light–dark cycle. Although the underlying molecular oscillatory mechanism is well studied, factors that influence phenotypic plasticity in daily activity patterns (temporal niche switching, chronotype) are presently unknown. Molecular evidence suggests that metabolism may influence the circadian molecular clock, but evidence at the level of the organism is lacking. Here we show that a metabolic challenge by cold and hunger induces diurnality in otherwise nocturnal mice. Lowering ambient temperature changes the phase of circadian light–dark entrainment in mice by increasing daytime and decreasing nighttime activity. This effect is further enhanced by simulated food shortage, which identifies metabolic balance as the underlying common factor influencing circadian organization. Clock gene expression analysis shows that the underlying neuronal mechanism is downstream from or parallel to the main circadian pacemaker (the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus) and that the behavioral phenotype is accompanied by phase adjustment of peripheral tissues. These findings indicate that nocturnal mammals can display considerable plasticity in circadian organization and may adopt a diurnal phenotype when energetically challenged. Our previously defined circadian thermoenergetics hypothesis proposes that such circadian plasticity, which naturally occurs in nocturnal mammals, reflects adaptive maintenance of energy balance. Quantification of energy expenditure shows that diurnality under natural conditions reduces thermoregulatory costs in small burrowing mammals like mice. Metabolic feedback on circadian organization thus provides functional benefits by reducing energy expenditure. Our findings may help to clarify relationships between sleep–wake patterns and metabolic phenotypes in humans.},

Besides similarities, clear differences are evident among and within Nasonia species as well as between sexes. In all species, activity in a light-dark cycle is concentrated in the photophase, typical for diurnal organisms. Contrary to most diurnal insect species so far studied, Nasonia follows Aschoff's rule by displaying long ({\textgreater}24 h) internal rhythms in constant darkness but short ({\textless}24 h) in constant light. In constant light, N. vitripennis males display robust circadian activity rhythms, whereas females are usually arrhythmic. In contrast to other Nasonia species, N. longicornis males display anticipatory activity, i.e. activity shortly before light-on in a light-dark cycle. As expected, N. oneida shows activity patterns similar to those of N. giraulti but with important differences in key circadian parameters. Differences in circadian activity patterns and parameters between species may reflect synchronization of specific life-history traits to environmental conditions. Scheduling mating or dispersion to a specific time of the day could be a strategy to avoid interspecific hybridization in Nasonia species that live in sympatry.},

This review summarizes recent work in the interactions of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations with host and symbiont circadian rhythms, focusing specifically on three mutualistic systems in which this phenomenon has been best studied. One important theme taken from these studies is the fact that mutualisms are profoundly affected by the circadian rhythms of the host, but that the microbial symbionts in these associations can, in turn, manipulate host rhythms. The interplay between circadian rhythms and symbiosis is a promising new field with effects that should be kept in mind when designing future studies across biology.},

	abstract = {Insect seasonality is a known pattern that has intrigued ecologists for over 30 years. However, despite being well understood in general, for several taxa such as Lepidopteran caterpillars its underlying causes and mechanisms are still not fully understood. This is especially critical for Brazilian tropical forests where caterpillars have previously been shown to have a puzzling pattern of peaking in abundance only in the first months of the dry season; however, this pattern still lacks an explanation. Here, to advance our understanding of the factors underlying seasonal changes in caterpillar abundance in tropical forests, we addressed how the lepidopteran caterpillar community that feeds on Piper amalago L. plants, their host plants leaf numbers, the herbivory levels, and the parasitoid pressure all change throughout the dry and wet seasons in a Brazilian tropical semideciduous forest. We found that immature abundance and herbivory peak in the first 2 months of the dry season and then rapidly decrease and remain low throughout the remaining of the dry season and the entire wet season at the study site. However, although the proportion of parasitized immatures increased alongside caterpillar abundance, it peaked in the month that followed a drastic decrease in caterpillar abundance. These results suggest that parasitoids play a major role in the observed caterpillar abundance pattern and thus, we propose the hypothesis that high parasitoid predation pressure causes early eclosion and emergence of caterpillars and primarily drives caterpillar abundance seasonality in Brazilian tropical forests.},

However, the rhythm correlations among the three levels and the underlying mechanisms in any tritrophic system are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rhythms exhibited bidirectional correlations in a model tritrophic system involving a lima bean, a pea leafminer and a parasitoid. From the bottom-up perspective, the rhythm was initiated from herbivore feeding, which triggered the rhythms of volatile emissions; then the rhythmic pattern of parasitoid activities was affected, and these rhythms were synchronized by a light switch signal. Increased volatile concentration can enhance the intensity of parasitoid locomotion and oviposition only under light. From the top-down perspective, naive and oviposition-experienced parasitoids were able to utilize the different volatile rhythm information from the damaged plant to locate host leafminers respectively. Our results indicated that the three interacting organisms in this system can achieve rhythmic functional synchronization under a natural light-dark photoperiod, but not under constant light or darkness. These findings provide new insight into the rhythm synchronization of three key players that contribute to the utilization of light and chemical signals, and our results may be used as potential approaches for manipulating natural enemies.},

However, relatively few studies demonstrate a temporal shift that is predation- or competition-induced. Recorded shifts are usually within the preferred activity phase of animal species (day or night), although there are some inversions to the opposite phase cycle. Temporal partitioning is not perceived as a common mechanism of coexistence. This rarity has been variously ascribed to theoretical considerations and to the rigidity of time-keeping mechanisms, as well as to other physiological and anatomical traits that may constrain activity patterns. Our decade-long study of spiny mice of rocky deserts demonstrates that, while different factors select for activity patterns, endogenous rhythmicity may be an evolutionary constraint.},

	abstract = {Many animals regulate their activity over a 24-h sleep–wake cycle, concentrating their peak periods of activity to coincide with the hours of daylight, darkness, or twilight, or using different periods of light and darkness in more complex ways. These behavioral differences, which are in themselves functional traits, are associated with suites of physiological and morphological adaptations with implications for the ecological roles of species. The biogeography of diel time partitioning is, however, poorly understood. Here, we document basic biogeographic patterns of time partitioning by mammals and ecologically relevant large-scale patterns of natural variation in “illuminated activity time” constrained by temperature, and we determine how well the first of these are predicted by the second. Although the majority of mammals are nocturnal, the distributions of diurnal and crepuscular species richness are strongly associated with the availability of biologically useful daylight and twilight, respectively. Cathemerality is associated with relatively long hours of daylight and twilight in the northern Holarctic region, whereas the proportion of nocturnal species is highest in arid regions and lowest at extreme high altitudes. Although thermal constraints on activity have been identified as key to the distributions of organisms, constraints due to functional adaptation to the light environment are less well studied. Global patterns in diversity are constrained by the availability of the temporal niche; disruption of these constraints by the spread of artificial lighting and anthropogenic climate change, and the potential effects on time partitioning, are likely to be critical influences on species’ future distributions.},

In the present study, we confirm these results and extend them to a biologically relevant odor, the urine of the red fox, a rodent predator. Fos induced by exposure of rats to fox urine or a neutral odor, mineral oil, was markedly enhanced during the subjective night compared to subjective day in the main olfactory bulb, primary olfactory cortex, and other structures related to olfaction. These results show that neuronal responses to an ethologically relevant odor follow a circadian rhythm similar to biologically neutral odors. Fos responses induced by fox urine were observed to be of greater magnitude than a neutral odor in brain areas involved in fear responses, suggesting that fox urine activates fear circuitry.},

Activity patterns are shaped by physiological constraints, evolutionary history, circadian and seasonal changes and may be influenced by other factors, including ecological competition and interspecific interactions. Remote-sensing camera traps allow the collection of species presence data throughout the 24 h period and for almost indefinite lengths of time. Here, we collate data from 10 separate camera trap surveys in order to describe circadian and seasonal activity patterns of 10 mammal species, and, in particular, to evaluate interspecific (dis)associations of five predator-prey pairs. We recorded 8,761 independent detections throughout Northern Ireland. Badgers, foxes, pine martens and wood mice were nocturnal; European and Irish hares and European rabbits were crepuscular; fallow deer and grey and red squirrels were diurnal. All species exhibited significant seasonal variation in activity relative to the timing of sunrise/sunset. Foxes in particular were more crepuscular from spring to autumn and hares more diurnal. Lagged regression analyses of predator-prey activity patterns between foxes and prey (hares, rabbits and wood mice), and pine marten and prey (squirrel and wood mice) revealed significant annual and seasonal cross-correlations. We found synchronised activity patterns between foxes and hares, rabbits and wood mice and pine marten and wood mice, and asynchrony between squirrels and pine martens. Here, we provide fundamental ecological data on endemic, invasive, pest and commercially valuable species in Ireland, as well as those of conservation importance and those that could harbour diseases of economic and/or zoonotic relevance. Our data will be valuable in informing the development of appropriate species-specific methodologies and processes and associated policies.},

Included in the radio-collared field group were 30 chipmunks with supra-chiasmatic nucleus-targeted lesions, 24 surgical controls, and 20 intact controls. An additional 17 chipmunks were used in a laboratory study as lesion-calibration controls to correlate degree of circadian arrhythmicity with extent of supra-chiasmatic nucleus deletion. Survival was documented in the field by daily radio tracking and by regular trapping censuses except during winter hibernation. A significantly higher proportion of supra-chiasmatic nucleus-lesioned than surgical control chipmunks or intact controls were killed by weasel predation during the first 80 days after repatriation. A 28-h continuous census found no surface activity of any chipmunks during hours of darkness. However, episodes of nocturnal movement were detected within the permanent dens by radio telemetric data logging, especially in supra-chiasmatic nucleus-lesioned animals. Excavation and mapping of six chipmunk burrow systems aided in the interpretation of the telemetric activity data. Nighttime restlessness of supra-chiasmatic nucleus-lesioned animals may have acted as a clue to the predator for locating its prey.},

	abstract = {For many animals, selecting whether to forage during day or night is a critical fitness problem: at night, predation risks are lower but feeding is less efficient. Habitat selection is a closely related problem: the best location for nocturnal foraging could be too risky during daytime, and habitat that is safe and profitable in daytime may be unprofitable at night. We pose a theory that assumes animals select the combination of daytime and night activity (feeding vs. hiding), and habitat, that maximizes expected future fitness. Expected fitness is approximated as the predicted probability of surviving starvation and predation over a future time horizon, multiplied by a function representing the fitness benefits of growth. The theory's usefulness and generality were tested using pattern-oriented analysis of an individual-based model (IBM) of stream salmonids and the extensive literature on observed diel behavior patterns of these animals. Simulation experiments showed that the IBM reproduces eight diverse patterns observed in real populations. (1) Diel activity (whether foraging occurs during day and/or night) varies among a population's individuals, and from day to day for each individual. (2) Salmonids feed in shallower and slower water at night. (3) Individuals pack more tightly into the best habitat when feeding at night. (4) Salmonids feed relatively more at night if temperatures (and, therefore, metabolic demands) are low. (5) Daytime feeding is more common for life stages in which potential fitness increases more rapidly with growth. (6) Competition for feeding or hiding sites can shift foraging between day and night. (7) Daytime feeding is more common when food availability is low. (8) Diel activity patterns are affected by the availability of good habitat for feeding or hiding. We can explain many patterns of variation in diel foraging behavior without assuming that populations or individuals vary in how inherently nocturnal or diurnal they are. Instead, these patterns can emerge from the search by individuals for good trade-offs between growth and survival under different habitat and competitive conditions.},

	abstract = {We have assessed the effect of copepod chemical cues on the diel feeding rhythms of heterotrophic and mixotrophic marine protists. All phagotrophic protists studied exhibited relatively high diurnal feeding rates. The magnitude of the diel feeding rhythm, expressed as the quotient of day and night ingestion rates, was inversely related to the time that phagotrophic protists were maintained in the laboratory in an environment without predators. In the case of the recently isolated ciliate Strombidium arenicola, the rhythm was lost after a few months. When challenged with chemical alarm signals (copepodamides) from the copepod Calanus finmarchicus at realistic concentrations (0.6–6 pM), S. arenicola partially re-established diurnal feeding. Conversely, the amplitude of the diel feeding rhythm for the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum was not affected by copepodamides, although the 24-h integrated food intake increased by approximately 23\%. For the dinoflagellates Gyrodinium dominans and Karlodinium armiger, copepodamides significantly reduced the amplitude of their diel feeding rhythms; significant positive effects on total daily ingestion were only observed in G. dominans. Finally, the dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina, isolated {\textgreater}20 years ago, showed inconsistent responses to copepodamides, except for an average 6\% increase in its total ingestion over 24 h. Our results demonstrate that the predation risk by copepods affects the diel feeding rhythm of marine protists and suggests a species-specific response to predation threats.},

	abstract = {Considerable research is aimed at developing predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change, focusing on the spatial scale, such as range shifts and contractions, as well as activity restrictions to shaded microhabitats. On the other hand, the ability of species to shift their activity times during the diel cycle, and consequently to alter the environment in which activity occurs, has been largely neglected. Daily activity patterns are perceived as fairly fixed; however, natural changes in activity patterns have been reported in increasing numbers of species. Here, we present a framework that explores how shifts in activity patterns may buffer impacts of climate change. To demonstrate our framework, we simulated costs of activity of diurnal and nocturnal rodents and showed that future summers may decrease the energetic demands of nocturnal mammals while increasing water demands of diurnal mammals. Climate projections suggest that vegetation cover and water availability will decrease under future climate scenarios, especially in areas where water demands are expected to increase the most. These changes are expected to limit the ability of diurnal animals to restrict activity to shaded microhabitats and to keep a positive water balance. Our analysis shows that by shifting to nocturnality, diurnal mammals may mitigate the high water costs of future summers. We suggest that future research should explore the role of the diel time axis as an ecological resource when predicting the impacts of climate change.},

	abstract = {The activity patterns exhibited by animals are shaped by evolution, but additionally fine-tuned by flexible responses to the environment. Predation risk and resource availability are environmental cues which influence the behavioural decisions that make both predators and prey engage in activity bursts, and depending on their local importance, can be strong enough to override the endogenous regulation of an animals’ circadian clock. In Southern Europe, wherever the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is abundant, it is the main prey of most mammalian mesopredators, and rodents are generally the alternative prey. We evaluated the bidirectional relation between the diel activity strategies of these mammalian mesopredators and prey coexisting in south-western Europe. Results revealed that even though predation risk enforced by mammalian mesocarnivores during night-time was approximately twice and five times higher than during twilight and daytime, respectively, murids consistently displayed unimodal nocturnal behaviour. Conversely, the European rabbits exhibited a bimodal pattern that peaked around sunrise and sunset. Despite the existence of some overlap between the diel rhythms of mesocarnivores and rabbits, their patterns were not synchronized. We suggest that the environmental stressors in our study areas are not severe enough to override the endogenous regulation of the circadian cycle in murids. European rabbits, however, are able to suppress their biological tendency for nocturnality by selecting a predominantly crepuscular pattern. In spite of the higher energetic input, mesocarnivores do not completely track rabbits’ activity pattern. They rather track rodents’ activity. We propose that these systems have probably evolved towards a situation where some degree of activity during high-risk periods benefits the overall prey population survival, while the accessibility to sufficient prey prevents predators to completely track them.},

	abstract = {The response of prey to predation risk varies through time and space. These responses relate to trade-offs between foraging and predator avoidance. Following the extirpation of predators from many landscapes, the responses related to predator avoidance may have been lost or diluted. Investigating the activity pattern of prey species on comparable landscapes with and without large predators provides an opportunity to understand how predators may shape prey activity and behaviour. Using camera trap data from neighbouring fenced sections of the Addo Elephant National Park (Eastern Cape, South Africa), we investigated the activity patterns of species exposed to large predators, where the predators were only present in one of the sections. Our results suggest that prey species at risk of predation (e.g., buffalo, kudu and warthog) are more likely to be active diurnally when co-existing with nocturnally active predators, thereby reducing the activity overlap with these predators. In the absence of predators, kudu and buffalo were more active at night resulting in a low overlap in activity between sections. Warthog activity was predominantly diurnal in both sections, resulting in a high overlap in activity between sections. The presence of predators reduced the nocturnal activity of warthogs from 6 to 0.6 \% of all warthog captures in each section. Elephants, which are above the preferred prey weight range of the predators and therefore have a low risk of predation, showed higher overlap in activity periodicity between predator-present and predator-absent areas. Our findings suggest that maintaining prey with their predators has the added benefit of conserving the full spectrum of prey adaptive behaviours.},

	abstract = {Limiting similarity theory predicts that competing species must segregate along one or more dimensions of their ecological niche in order to coexist. In predator communities, interspecific interactions are influenced by a diversity of factors; therefore, the behavioural patterns of composing species will differ due to locally adapted interactions. We deployed 32–41 camera-traps in five study areas across the Iberian Peninsula to investigate the temporal relations between mesocarnivores in SW Europe. The selection for a period of the diel cycle and plasticity in activity patterns was evaluated using the Jacobs Selection Index (JSI) and the coefficient of activity overlap (∆1). Furthermore, we investigated whether temporal shifts can facilitate coexistence by reducing activity overlap. Seven species of mesocarnivores were detected and were assigned into one of three behaviourally distinct groups: diurnal (JSIday ≥ 0.8), strictly nocturnal (JSInight ≥ 0.8) or facultative nocturnal species (0.4 ≥ JSInight {\textgreater} 0.8). Most species exhibited substantial flexibility, which allowed them to locally adapt their foraging strategies (intraspecific ∆1 = 0.70–0.77). Mean Δ1 from all interspecific pairwise comparisons was negatively correlated with the number of carnivore species with ≥10 detections (r −0.76, p = 0.02). Our results suggest that temporal segregation is likely to play an important role in facilitating mesocarnivore coexistence, especially with increasing community complexity, where most species’ activity peaks were asynchronous. These results contribute to understanding the dynamics and behavioural strategies of coexisting mesocarnivores, crucial for forecasting the possible outcomes of conservation or management actions.},

However, to build a robust deep neural network classifier model, sufficient number of image data is necessary. In preparing image data, collection and annotation of large datasets can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. This work aims to reduce the effort and time needed to perform such tasks. In this research, a method for synthesizing insect pest training images in sticky paper trap images and enhancing the performance of insect pest convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier models through a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed. Through GAN, images were synthesized to balance and increase the number of training images even with limited data. The fidelity of the synthetic images was tested using t-SNE visualization. To evaluate the developed network, the minimum number of images required to apply GAN-based augmentation was determined. Furthermore, the performance of the insect pest classifier models without augmentation, with traditional augmentation, and with GAN-based augmentation were compared. Testing results show that the classifier models trained with images augmented using GAN achieved an F1-score of 0.95, outperforming the models trained with traditionally augmented images with an F1-score of 0.92. This research shows that by using GAN-based augmentation method, the insect pest CNN classification models can yield a better performance compared to classic augmentation method and reduce the effort needed for data collection. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be easily adapted to various agricultural applications using deep neural networks when image data is limited.},

	abstract = {Integrated pest management relies on insect pest monitoring to support the decision of counteracting a given level of infestation and to select the adequate control method. The classic monitoring approach of insect pests is based on placing in single infested areas a series of traps that are checked by human operators on a temporal basis. This strategy requires high labor cost and provides poor spatial and temporal resolution achievable by single operators. The adoption of image sensors to monitor insect pests can result in several practical advantages. The purpose of this review is to summarize the progress made on automatic traps with a particular focus on camera-equipped traps. The use of software and image recognition algorithms can support automatic trap usage to identify and/or count insect species from pictures. Considering the high image resolution achievable and the opportunity to exploit data transfer systems through wireless technology, it is possible to have remote control of insect captures, limiting field visits. The availability of real-time and on-line pest monitoring systems from a distant location opens the opportunity for measuring insect population dynamics constantly and simultaneously in a large number of traps with a limited human labor requirement. The actual limitations are the high cost, the low power autonomy and the low picture quality of some prototypes together with the need for further improvements in fully automated pest detection. Limits and benefits resulting from several case studies are examined with a perspective for the future development of technology-driven insect pest monitoring and management.},

While the first scientific observation of circadian rhythm in the plant leaf movement may be dated back to the early 18th century, it took 200 years to realize that the leaf movement is controlled by an endogenous circadian clock. The cloning and characterization of the first Drosophila clock gene period in the early 1980s, independently by Jeffery C. Hall and Michael Rosbash at Brandeis University and Michael Young at Rockefeller University, paved the way for their further discoveries of additional genes and proteins, culminating in establishing the so-called transcriptional translational feedback loop (TTFL) model for the generation of autonomous oscillator with a period of ∼24 h. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to honor their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm.},

	abstract = {The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for understanding the molecular nature of circadian (∼24 hr) rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases, act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons, although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep. Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory, courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian rhythms.},

	abstract = {The development of insecticides requires valid risk assessment procedures to avoid causing harm to beneficial insects and especially to pollinators such as the honeybee Apis mellifera. In addition to testing according to current guidelines designed to detect bee mortality, tests are needed to determine possible sublethal effects interfering with the animal's vitality and behavioral performance. Several methods have been used to detect sublethal effects of different insecticides under laboratory conditions using olfactory conditioning. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on the influence insecticides have on foraging activity and homing ability which require time-consuming visual observation. We tested an experimental design using the radiofrequency identification (RFID) method to monitor the influence of sublethal doses of insecticides on individual honeybee foragers on an automated basis. With electronic readers positioned at the hive entrance and at an artificial food source, we obtained quantifiable data on honeybee foraging behavior. This enabled us to efficiently retrieve detailed information on flight parameters. We compared several groups of bees, fed simultaneously with different dosages of a tested substance. With this experimental approach we monitored the acute effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid (0.15–6 ng/bee) and clothianidin (0.05–2 ng/bee) under field-like circumstances. At field-relevant doses for nectar and pollen no adverse effects were observed for either substance. Both substances led to a significant reduction of foraging activity and to longer foraging flights at doses of ≥0.5 ng/bee (clothianidin) and ≥1.5 ng/bee (imidacloprid) during the first three hours after treatment. This study demonstrates that the RFID-method is an effective way to record short-term alterations in foraging activity after insecticides have been administered once, orally, to individual bees. We contribute further information on the understanding of how honeybees are affected by sublethal doses of insecticides.},

The parameters typically analyzed in this context include species diversity, colony condition and foraging behavior. Bees explore the area around their nests, whose size and location vary based on the flight ranges and nesting preferences of the respective species. The environment around the nest must contain appropriate resources, which are collected by bees during foraging. Therefore, the internal nest environment is connected to the external environment via foraging. Until early 2000, direct observations and/or video recording of the foraging activity of social bees were the predominant techniques for studying foraging behavior, and paint marks or labels were used to distinguish individuals. Although these techniques are still used, radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has been used for bee monitoring and can automatically count the inbound and outbound movements of bees from the nest and perform individual recognition. Here, we review the applications of RFID technology in bee research and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of RFID compared with those of other techniques.},

While colonies often respond to changing environmental conditions by flexibly reallocating workers to different tasks, the factors determining which workers switch and why are not well understood. Here, we use an automated tracking system to continuously monitor nest behavior and foraging activity of uniquely identified workers from entire bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies foraging in a natural outdoor environment. We show that most foraging is performed by a small number of workers and that the intensity and distribution of foraging is actively regulated at the colony level in response to forager removal. By analyzing worker nest behavior before and after forager removal, we show that spatial fidelity of workers within the nest generates uneven interaction with relevant localized information sources, and predicts which workers initiate foraging after disturbance. Our results highlight the importance of spatial fidelity for structuring information flow and regulating collective behavior in social insect colonies.},

	abstract = {To accommodate daily recurring environmental changes, animals show cyclic variations in behaviour and physiology, which include prominent behavioural states such as sleep–wake cycles but also a host of less conspicuous oscillations in neurological, metabolic, endocrine, cardiovascular and immune functions. Circadian rhythmicity is created endogenously by genetically encoded molecular clocks, whose components cooperate to generate cyclic changes in their own abundance and activity, with a periodicity of about a day. Throughout the body, such molecular clocks convey temporal control to the function of organs and tissues by regulating pertinent downstream programmes. Synchrony between the different circadian oscillators and resonance with the solar day is largely enabled by a neural pacemaker, which is directly responsive to certain environmental cues and able to transmit internal time-of-day representations to the entire body. In this Review, we discuss aspects of the circadian clock in Drosophila melanogaster and mammals, including the components of these molecular oscillators, the function and mechanisms of action of central and peripheral clocks, their synchronization and their relevance to human health.},

Patients were matched into pairs by propensity score. We also did a randomised study, in which we evaluated perioperative myocardial injury and myocardial samples of patients randomly assigned (1:1) via permuted block randomisation (block size of eight) to undergo isolated aortic valve replacement surgery either in the morning or afternoon. We also evaluated human and rodent myocardium in ex-vivo hypoxia–reoxygenation models and did a transcriptomic analysis in myocardial samples from the randomised patients to identify the signalling pathway(s) involved. The primary objective of the study was to assess whether myocardial tolerance of ischaemia–reperfusion differed depending on the timing of aortic valve replacement surgery (morning \textit{vs} afternoon), as measured by the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and admission to hospital for acute heart failure).

In the randomised study, 88 patients were randomly assigned to undergo surgery in the morning (n=44) or afternoon (n=44); perioperative myocardial injury assessed with the geometric mean of perioperative cardiac troponin T release was significantly lower in the afternoon group than in the morning group (estimated ratio of geometric means for afternoon to morning of 0·79 [95\% CI 0·68–0·93; p=0·0045]). Ex-vivo analysis of human myocardium revealed an intrinsic morning–afternoon variation in hypoxia–reoxygenation tolerance, concomitant with transcriptional alterations in circadian gene expression with the nuclear receptor Rev-Erbα being highest in the morning. In a mouse Langendorff model of hypoxia–reoxygenation myocardial injury, \textit{Rev-Erb}α gene deletion or antagonist treatment reduced injury at the time of sleep-to-wake transition, through an increase in the expression of the ischaemia–reperfusion injury modulator CDKN1a/p21.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Perioperative myocardial injury is transcriptionally orchestrated by the circadian clock in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, and Rev-Erbα antagonism seems to be a pharmacological strategy for cardioprotection.

	abstract = {Recently, deep learning based video super-resolution (SR) methods have achieved promising performance. To simultaneously exploit the spatial and temporal information of videos, employing 3-dimensional (3D) convolutions is a natural approach. However, straight utilizing 3D convolutions may lead to an excessively high computational complexity which restricts the depth of video SR models and thus undermine the performance. In this paper, we present a novel fast spatio-temporal residual network (FSTRN) to adopt 3D convolutions for the video SR task in order to enhance the performance while maintaining a low computational load. Specifically, we propose a fast spatio-temporal residual block (FRB) that divide each 3D filter to the product of two 3D filters, which have considerably lower dimensions. Furthermore, we design a cross-space residual learning that directly links the low-resolution space and the high-resolution space, which can greatly relieve the computational burden on the feature fusion and up-scaling parts. Extensive evaluations and comparisons on benchmark datasets validate the strengths of the proposed approach and demonstrate that the proposed network significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Daily flight activity patterns of forest insects are influenced by temporal and meteorological conditions. Temperature and time of day are frequently cited as key drivers of activity; however, complex interactions between multiple contributing factors have also been proposed. Here, we report individual Bayesian network models to assess the probability of flight activity of three exotic insects, Hylurgus ligniperda, Hylastes ater, and Arhopalus ferus in a managed plantation forest context. Models were built from 7,144 individual hours of insect sampling, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, photon flux density, and temporal data. Discretized meteorological and temporal variables were used to build naïve Bayes tree augmented networks. Calibration results suggested that the H. ater and A. ferus Bayesian network models had the best fit for low Type I and overall errors, and H. ligniperda had the best fit for low Type II errors. Maximum hourly temperature and time since sunrise had the largest influence on H. ligniperda flight activity predictions, whereas time of day and year had the greatest influence on H. ater and A. ferus activity. Type II model errors for the prediction of no flight activity is improved by increasing the model’s predictive threshold. Improvements in model performance can be made by further sampling, increasing the sensitivity of the flight intercept traps, and replicating sampling in other regions. Predicting insect flight informs an assessment of the potential phytosanitary risks of wood exports. Quantifying this risk allows mitigation treatments to be targeted to prevent the spread of invasive species via international trade pathways.},

	abstract = {The Oriental Fruit Fly (OFF), Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), is one of most devastating insect pests that have periodically caused serious damage to fruit farms in Taiwan and many countries in the world. In the past, many studies reported that the population dynamics of OFF was partially correlated to the weather and the historical population development of OFF in the field. By making the best use of modern info-communication technologies (ICTs), long-term pest population data and microclimate variables measured with uniquely fine spatiotemporal resolution are now available to reveal the population dynamics of OFF. An analysis of data over three years using the Vector Auto-Regressive and Moving-Average model with eXogenous variables (VARMAX) was proposed to unravel the regulatory mechanism between the population dynamics of OFF and microclimate factors. In addition, the proposed model provides a 7-day forecast for population dynamics of OFF. The accuracy of 7-day risk level forecasting yielded by the proposed model ranges from 0.87 to 0.97, and the average root-mean squared errors of forecasting the population dynamics fall in the interval between 0.31 and 4.95 per day per farm. The proposed forecasting model can allow authorities to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of OFF and anticipate pest-related problems, so they can make preemptive and effective pest management decisions before the real problems occur.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean Fruit Fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), is considered to be one of the most destructive fruit insect pests throughout the world. In recent years, the temporal dynamics of the medfly have been extensively studied by season, and, to a lesser extent, on a daily basis. We exploited, for the first time, a sequential automatic medfly male trapping system, in combination with climate data, to characterize diel flight patterns of male medflies trapped. The process was carried out in four commercial citrus fields over three growing seasons. Results showed that throughout the year, medfly flight activity began 4–6 hr after sunrise and peaked up to 2 to 3 hr before sunset. Generalized additive models (GAM) of the 934 days sampled revealed that in the fall, the diurnal flight activity was unimodal, that is, it began increasing at noon, peaking in the afternoon. By contrast, in the spring and summer, the diurnal flight activity exhibited a bimodal pattern, decreasing at midday. GAMs also revealed that hour after sunrise and temperature influenced medfly captures, with the former the more dominant factor. Thus, photophase significantly impacted the medfly's diurnal flight activity in each season. This study demonstrated that automatic traps that timestamp each capture are a primary research tool in insect flight activity studies that contributes to understanding diurnal insect activity within the growing season.},

Using data obtained from traps to make management decisions is not an easy task and involves significant costs in equipment, transport and labour. Thanks to the spread and the low prices of information and communication technologies, innovative automated capture devices including electronic sensors and connecting components are increasingly being developed, allow facing some of the current monitoring constrains in a context of IPM. In this paper, we illustrated the state of the art of this field and provide insights on automated devices, consisting of traps equipped with sensors and other components for the collection of data in the field and their transmission to a remote server accessible online, with information stored in georeferenced databases. Optical sensors are mainly used for detecting photo-interruptions, images or optoacoustic spectrum of wingbeats. The monitoring systems can be equipped with software for image interpretation and identification of the caught target insect pest (fully automated system) or a remote operator can count the trapped insects by watching the images coming from the e-trap (semi-automated system). The software can integrate a decision support system (DSS) module, which provides information on the risk of infestation and the actions to be taken (when, where, how to make a control application). The development and future prospects of automated devices are discussed in relation to the technical reliability of the system, ease of use and costs compared to traditional monitoring methods.},

	abstract = {Continuous monitoring of population fluctuations is important to improve the control of economic pests. The Mediterranean fruit fly [medfly; Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann)] is a major economic pest of fruit crops worldwide, particularly in the Middle East. The current medfly weekly monitoring method, manual counting, results in a suboptimal spraying frequency in citrus orchards. This paper describes the development of an automatic trap for sequential medfly remote monitoring. To our knowledge, it is the first automatic trap developed for medfly monitoring. A new cylinder-shaped trap was designed, and optical sensors specifically created for detecting and counting dead or stunted Medflies were embedded in it. Field tests were conducted to estimate the trapping efficiency, accuracy and over-counting of the medfly Automatic Traps (medfly-ATs). medfly-ATs and Steiner traps were placed in commercial citrus orchards over five different periods between the years 2013 and 2015. The medfly-AT and conventional Steiner trap were found to have similar trapping efficiencies under field conditions. The accuracy of the medfly-AT counts ranged between 88\% and 100\%; the absolute over-counting in all experimental sites and periods was three flies. Over-counting was mostly due to ants and rain. The paper discusses the importance of field tests in evaluating the performance of automatic traps. Results of an informal experiment conducted in a commercial orchard showed that daily monitoring using the medfly-AT device holds promise for reducing insecticide applications, but extensive in-field experiments should be conducted to prove it.},

The discovery of clock genes and the molecular clockwork has helped researchers to understand the possible role of these genes in regulating various metabolic processes. In Drosophila melanogaster, many studies have shown that the basic architecture of circadian clocks is multi-oscillatory. In nature, different neuronal subgroups in the brain of D. melanogaster have been demonstrated to control different circadian behavioural rhythms or different aspects of the same circadian rhythm. Among the circadian phenomena that have been studied so far in Drosophila, the egg-laying rhythm is unique, and relatively less explored. Unlike most other circadian rhythms, the egg-laying rhythm is rhythmic under constant light conditions, and the endogenous or free-running period of the rhythm is greater than those of most other rhythms. Although the clock genes and neurons required for the persistence of adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms have been studied extensively, those underlying the circadian egg-laying rhythm still remain largely unknown. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the circadian egg-laying rhythm in D. melanogaster, and the possible molecular and physiological mechanisms that control the rhythmic output of the egg-laying process.},

The bootstrap procedure is very simple, and it is adaptable to a wide variety of MDS models. Our approach enhances the utility of multidimensional scaling as a tool for testing substantive theories while still retaining the flexibility in assumptions, model details, and estimation procedures that make MDS so useful for exploring structure in data.},

We documented three particularly interesting behaviors: abdominal lifting, stopping, and retreat—which were performed at higher frequency by D. melanogaster in the presence of predators. While mantids had only a modest influence on the locomotory activity of D. melanogaster, we observed a significant increase in the overall activity of D. melanogaster in the presence of jumping spiders. Finally, we observed considerable among-individual behavioral variation in response to both predators.},

While extensive progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of biological clocks, there have been few clear demonstrations of the fitness value of endogenous rhythms. This study investigated the adaptive significance of circadian rhythms in a Drosophila parasitoid community. The activity rhythms of three sympatric Drosophila parasitoids are out of phase, the competitively inferior parasitoid species being active earlier than the superior competitor. This temporal segregation appears at least partially determined by endogenous periods of the clock which also vary between species and which correlate the time of activity. This earlier activity of the inferior competitor significantly reduces its intrinsic competitive disadvantage when multiparasitism occurs, thus suggesting that natural selection acting on the phase of the rhythm could substantially deviate the endogenous period from the optimal ca. 24 h period. This study demonstrates that temporal segregation of competing species could be endogenously controlled, which undoubtedly favours their coexistence in nature and also shows how natural selection can act on biological clocks to shape daily activity patterns.},

Circadian clocks regulate the physiology and behaviour of organisms across a wide range of taxa. To keep track of local time, these clocks use a variety of time cues such as light–dark, temperature, food availability and social interaction cycles. This study assessed the role of social cues in modulating circadian clocks of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using pair-wise interactions, we first estimated the percentage contribution of each interacting partner on the cumulative rhythmic behaviour of the pairs. Subsequently, we studied the effects of multi-individual (group-wise) interactions on the rhythmic behaviour of the group by estimating phase synchrony between individuals of different strains (having different circadian periods) maintained in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. Although it is known that social interactions improve synchrony between interacting individuals, we asked whether such interactions are able to synchronize the circadian rhythms of highly phase-desynchronized flies. We found that, although interactions between fly strains possessing different circadian periods failed to produce synchrony, social interactions among phase-desynchronized flies did enhance the phase synchrony of the interacting individuals. Differently phased individuals living in social groups displayed significantly greater phase synchrony than those living solitarily. Social synchronization is olfaction mediated as group-wise interactions among phase-desynchronized flies possessing compromised olfactory ability (Or83b0) did not improve phase synchrony. These results suggest that social cues synchronize the circadian clocks of Drosophila provided that the interacting individuals have similar clock periods.},

Non-genetic individuality in behavior, also termed intragenotypic variability, has been observed across many different organisms. A potential cause of intragenotypic variability is sensitivity to minute environmental differences during development, which are present even when major environmental parameters are kept constant. Animal enrichment paradigms often include the addition of environmental diversity, whether in the form of social interaction, novel objects or exploratory opportunities. Enrichment could plausibly affect intragenotypic variability in opposing ways: it could cause an increase in variability due to the increase in microenvironmental variation, or a decrease in variability due to elimination of aberrant behavior as animals are taken out of impoverished laboratory conditions. In order to test these hypothesis, we assayed five isogenic Drosophila melanogaster lines raised in control and mild enrichment conditions, and one isogenic line under both mild and intense enrichment conditions. We compared the mean and variability of six behavioral metrics between our enriched fly populations and the laboratory housing control. We found that enrichment often caused a small increase in variability across most of our behaviors, but that the ultimate effect of enrichment on both behavioral means and variabilities was highly dependent on genotype and its interaction with the particular enrichment treatment. Our results support previous work on enrichment that presents a highly variable picture of its effects on both behavior and physiology.},

	abstract = {Hosts have numerous defenses against parasites, of which behavioral immune responses are an important but underappreciated component. Here we describe a behavioral immune response that Drosophila melanogaster uses against endoparasitoid wasps. We found that when flies see wasps, they switch to laying eggs in alcohol-laden food sources that protect hatched larvae from infection. This change in oviposition behavior, mediated by neuropeptide F, is retained long after wasps are removed. Flies respond to diverse female larval endoparasitoids but not to males or pupal endoparasitoids, showing that they maintain specific wasp search images. Furthermore, the response evolved multiple times across the genus Drosophila. Our data reveal a behavioral immune response based on anticipatory medication of offspring and outline a nonassociative memory paradigm based on innate parasite recognition by the host.
Flies deposit their eggs in protective, alcohol-rich environments when parasitic wasps are around.

	abstract = {Animal senses and signals are amazingly diverse, and the major modalities by which animals acquire sensory input from their environments are sound, light, vibration, and chemical signals. Insects mainly rely on visual, nociceptive, and olfactory cues to discriminate between rewards and risks. It has been shown that the visual and olfactory cues of predators substantially affect the adult phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster (Krams et al. 2016), a prominent animal model for biological research. A recent study has found that fruit flies can rely solely on vision in predator detection (de la Flor et al. 2017). However, the olfactory system of D. melanogaster is also highly developed and can be efficiently used in parasitoid (Ebrahim et al. 2015) and predator detection. Relying on olfaction as an additional sensory modality is adaptive because fruit flies may be active under conditions of low light when vision is limited as an antipredator tool (Izutsu et al. 2016). In this study, we investigated whether the larvae of D. melanogaster respond to chemical cues of spiders by changing adult body mass and stoichiometry of body nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in a similar way as it occurs in the presence of a real spider (Krams et al. 2016). The general stress paradigm (GSP) states that predator exposure generally increases the production of glucocorticosteroids in prey. Predator-induced stress generally causes oxidative stress and induces glucogenesis, which in turn increases metabolic rate, raising the overall demand for carbohydrate-based fuel and shifting the metabolic balance away from the anabolism that produces the nitrogen-rich (N) proteins necessary for growth (Hawlena and Schmitz 2010; Trakimas et al. 2019). These complex processes generally increase the C/N ratio (Hawlena and Schmitz 2010). However, D. melanogaster fruit flies reared together with spiders have a high concentration of body N and lower body mass, while their body C remains the same as fruit flies in the control group. Based on the results of Krams et al. (2016), we predicted higher N in flies reared with spiders and in flies grown in the presence of olfactory cues from spiders (but in absence of actual spiders), relative to flies in the control group. Methodological details can be found in the Supplementary materials.},

In Drosophila, exposure to parasitoid wasps leads to a sharp decline in oviposition. We show that exposure to predator elicits both an acute and learned oviposition depression, mediated through the visual system. However, long-term persistence of oviposition depression after predator removal requires neuronal signaling functions, a functional mushroom body, and neurally driven apoptosis of oocytes through effector caspases. Strikingly, wasp-exposed flies (teachers) can transmit egg-retention behavior and trigger ovarian apoptosis in naive, unexposed flies (students). Acquisition and behavioral execution of this socially learned behavior by naive flies requires all of the factors needed for primary learning. The ability to teach does not require ovarian apoptosis. This work provides new insight into genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie an ecologically relevant form of learning and mechanisms for its social transmission.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock modulates the adaptive daily patterns of physiology and behavior and adjusts these rhythms to seasonal changes. Recent studies of seasonal locomotor activity patterns of wild-type and clock mutant fruit flies in quasi-natural conditions have revealed that these behavioral patterns differ considerably from those observed under standard laboratory conditions. To unravel the molecular features accompanying seasonal adaptation of the clock, we investigated Drosophila’s neuronal expression of the canonical clock proteins PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) in nature. We find that the profile of PER dramatically changes in different seasons, whereas that of TIM remains more constant. Unexpectedly, we find that PER and TIM oscillations are decoupled in summer conditions. Moreover, irrespective of season, PER and TIM always peak earlier in the dorsal neurons than in the lateral neurons, suggesting a more rapid molecular oscillation in these cells. We successfully reproduced most of our results under simulated natural conditions in the laboratory and show that although photoperiod is the most important zeitgeber for the molecular clock, the flies’ activity pattern is more strongly affected by temperature. Our results are among the first to systematically compare laboratory and natural studies of Drosophila rhythms.},

Reduced apex predator occupancy or activity can release mesopredators from intraguild competition, with unknown repercussions on the ecological community. As exurban development continues to expand worldwide, it is important to document how mesopredators are impacted by the combined influences of apex predators and humans. We used motion-detecting camera traps to examine spatial and temporal patterns of meso- and apex predator occupancy and activity in a fragmented landscape in California. We hypothesized that both spatial and temporal partitioning among the carnivore guild would be affected by varied levels of human influence. We found that higher residential development reduced puma occupancy but was not related to the occupancy of mesopredators. Bobcats, grey foxes, and Virginia opossums were detected more often at sites occupied by pumas, whereas coyotes and raccoons were detected less often. The detection probabilities of smaller mesopredators were related to coyotes, a dominant mesopredator, but the magnitude and direction of these correlations differed depending upon puma occupancy. We also found that species altered their activities temporally in locations with higher human use, with pumas, bobcats and coyotes reducing diurnal activities and increasing nocturnal ones. These activity shifts were reflected in reduced temporal partitioning between intraguild competitors, with unknown effects on species interactions and repercussions to the prey community. Our results suggest that human development and activity alters predator community structure through both direct and indirect pathways. Therefore effective carnivore conservation requires an understanding of how mesopredators respond to varying levels of apex predator and anthropogenic influences.},

Data were collected from January 2013 to January 2015 by positioning camera traps in 200 sample stations. During 3479 trap days, we collected 1048 independent videos of target carnivore species, which revealed a general spatial coexistence among carnivores with some differences in seasonal occurrence of species. The red fox and the European badger showed temporal segregation, as their activity patterns suggested a differential use of night-time in all seasons. Activity patterns of the red fox and the wolf revealed moderate-high overlap and similar density distributions in all seasons except during winter. Coexistence between these species may be allowed by temporal segregation during winter and spatial segregation during spring. Finally, results regarding the European badger and the wolf suggest a moderate temporal segregation with a marked avoidance effect for the European badger induced by the presence of tracks left by wolves. Programmes aimed at carnivore conservation, and management should treat the entire guild, as it has been demonstrated that populations of different carnivores interact with each other in complex ways and that fine-scale mechanisms regulating carnivore assemblage influence different aspects of natural communities.},

One way to increase monitoring is through citizen science. ‘Citizen science’ is a term that we use in this chapter to describe the diverse approaches that involve people in monitoring in a voluntary capacity, thus including participatory monitoring in which people work collaboratively with scientists in developing monitoring. There is great unrealised potential for citizen science, especially in Asia and Africa. However, to fulfil this potential citizen science will need to meet local needs (for participants, communities and decision makers, including people's own use of the data and their motivations to participate) and support global needs for biodiversity monitoring (including the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets). Activities should be feasible (for participants to provide scientifically rigorous data) and useful (for data users, from local to global scales). We use examples from across the world to demonstrate how monitoring can engage different types of participants, through different technologies, to record different variables according to different sampling approaches. Overall, these examples show how citizen science has the potential to provide a step change in our ability to monitor biodiversity—and hence respond to threats at all scales from local to global.},

	abstract = {Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to exceptionally large datasets to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) validation of image-based taxonomic identification; 2) generation of sufficient training data; 3) development of public, curated reference databases; and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools.},

	abstract = {Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), an economically important pest of blueberry and other thin-skinned fruits, persists and prolifically reproduces under seemingly lethal climatic conditions in the field. However, behavioral and physiological mechanisms employed by D. suzukii to tolerate such extreme climatic conditions in the field are unknown. The primary objective of this project was to investigate diel periodicity of D. suzukii and their reproductive success under field conditions as related by climatic factors such as temperature and relative humidity. Results show that D. suzukii reproductive success was significantly higher during the night (including dawn and dusk periods) than the day in terms of oviposition, pupation, adult eclosion, and the number of progeny per female. Female D. suzukii reproductive success was not significantly different between specific regions of a blueberry bush in relation to the amount of shade provided by the canopy. Our studies indicate that D. suzukii flight activity is crepuscular and is sensitive to fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity. Results also suggest that the majority of fly activity during peak hours is concentrated in areas around the border and within the center of blueberry orchards with little activity in the surrounding wooded areas. These findings suggest that D. suzukii prefers microclimate with mild temperatures and high humidity, and does not function well when exposed to direct sunlight with extreme heat. The authors propose that D. suzukii management strategies should be implemented during the early morning and immediately before darkness to maximize efficacy.},

Generally, the peak occurs during the resting phase.In contrast to the peak number of circulating leukocytes, leukocyte recruitment to tissues occurs preferentially during the active phase of the organism. It is mediated by the in-phase expression of cell adhesion molecules and chemokines.The response of an organism to acute inflammatory insults exhibits circadian oscillations. This is probably due to the circadian regulation of leukocyte trafficking, of the expression of pathogen-sensitive receptors and of the phagocytic activity of leukocytes.Chronic diseases exhibit circadian exacerbations in their symptoms or presentations, which has been linked to an exaggeration of the circadian expression of pro-inflammatory mediators.Circadian rhythms should be taken into account when harvesting human tissue samples and in experimental settings using preclinical animal models. In addition, chronopharmacology holds great promise to provide benefits for clinical care in the future.},

Finally, we address a range of behaviors and physiological systems regulated by circadian clocks, including discussion of specific peripheral oscillators and key molecular effectors where they have been described.

	abstract = {Survival of bacterial infection is the result of complex host-pathogen interactions. An often-overlooked aspect of these interactions is the circadian state of the host. Previously, we demonstrated that Drosophila mutants lacking the circadian regulatory proteins Timeless (Tim) and Period (Per) are sensitive to infection by S. pneumoniae. Sensitivity to infection can be mediated either by changes in resistance (control of microbial load) or tolerance (endurance of the pathogenic effects of infection). Here we show that Tim regulates resistance against both S. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. We set out to characterize and identify the underlying mechanism of resistance that is circadian-regulated. Using S. pneumoniae, we found that resistance oscillates daily in adult wild-type flies and that these oscillations are absent in Tim mutants. Drosophila have at least three main resistance mechanisms to kill high levels of bacteria in their hemolymph: melanization, antimicrobial peptides, and phagocytosis. We found that melanization is not circadian-regulated. We further found that basal levels of AMP gene expression exhibit time-of-day oscillations but that these are Tim-independent; moreover, infection-induced AMP gene expression is not circadian-regulated. We then show that phagocytosis is circadian-regulated. Wild-type flies exhibit up-regulated phagocytic activity at night; Tim mutants have normal phagocytic activity during the day but lack this night-time peak. Tim appears to regulate an upstream event in phagocytosis, such as bacterial recognition or activation of phagocytic hemocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of phagocytosis in wild type flies results in survival kinetics similar to Tim mutants after infection with S. pneumoniae. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of circadian oscillation of a specific immune function (phagocytosis) can have significant effects on long-term survival of infection.},

To this end, we used infection of Drosophila with the human opportunistic pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa as our model system [1]. We show that the survival rates of wild-type flies vary as a function of when, during the day, they are infected, peaking in the middle of the night. Although this rhythm is abolished in clock mutant flies, those with an inactive period gene are highly susceptible to infection, whereas mutants with impairment in other core clock genes exhibit enhanced survival. After an initial phase of strong suppression, the kinetics of bacterial growth correlate highly with time of day and clock mutant effects on survival. Expression profiling revealed that nighttime infection leads to a clock-regulated transient burst in the expression of a limited number of innate immunity genes. Circadian modulation of survival also was observed with another pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. Our findings suggest that medical intervention strategies incorporating chronobiological considerations could enhance the innate immune response, boosting the efficacy of combating pathogenic infections.},

	abstract = {Under natural conditions, many aspects of the abiotic and biotic environment vary with time of day, season or even era, while these conditions are typically kept constant in laboratory settings. The timing information contained within the environment serves as critical timing cues for the internal biological timing system, but how this system drives daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology may also depend on the internal state of the animal. The disparity between timing of these cues in natural and laboratory conditions can result in substantial differences in the scheduling of behaviour and physiology under these conditions. In nature, temporal coordination of biological processes is critical to maximize fitness because they optimize the balance between reproduction, foraging and predation risk. Here we focus on the role of peripheral circadian clocks, and the rhythms that they drive, in enabling adaptive phenotypes. We discuss how reproduction, endocrine activity and metabolism interact with peripheral clocks, and outline the complex phenotypes arising from changes in this system. We conclude that peripheral timing is critical to adaptive plasticity of circadian organization in the field, and that we must abandon standard laboratory conditions to understand the mechanisms that underlie this plasticity which maximizes fitness under natural conditions.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wild clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals’.},

	abstract = {The selective properties of fishing that influence behavioural traits have recently gained interest. Recent acoustic tracking experiments have revealed between-individual differences in the circadian behavioural traits of marine free-living fish; these differences are consistent across time and ecological contexts and generate different chronotypes. Here, we hypothesised that the directional selection resulting from fishing influences the wild circadian behavioural variation and affects differently to individuals in the same population differing in certain traits such as awakening time or rest onset time. We developed a spatially explicit social-ecological individual-based model (IBM) to test this hypothesis. The parametrisation of our IBM was fully based on empirical data; which represent a fishery formed by patchily distributed diurnal resident fish that are exploited by a fleet of mobile boats (mostly bottom fisheries). We ran our IBM with and without the observed circadian behavioural variation and estimated selection gradients as a quantitative measure of trait change. Our simulations revealed significant and strong selection gradients against early-riser chronotypes when compared with other behavioural and life-history traits. Significant selection gradients were consistent across a wide range of fishing effort scenarios. Our theoretical findings enhance our understanding of the selective properties of fishing by bridging the gaps among three traditionally separated fields: fisheries science, behavioural ecology and chronobiology. We derive some general predictions from our theoretical findings and outline a list of empirical research needs that are required to further understand the causes and consequences of circadian behavioural variation in marine fish.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection favours the expression of traits in one sex that attract members of the opposite sex for mating. The nature of sexually selected traits such as vocalization, colour and ornamentation, their fitness benefits as well as their costs have received ample attention in field and laboratory studies. However, sexually selected traits may not always be expressed: coloration and ornaments often follow a seasonal pattern and behaviours may be displayed only at specific times of the day. Despite the widely recognized differences in the daily and seasonal timing of traits and their consequences for reproductive success, the actions of sexual selection on the temporal organization of traits has received only scant attention. Drawing on selected examples from bird and mammal studies, here we summarize the current evidence for the daily and seasonal timing of traits. We highlight that molecular advances in chronobiology have opened exciting new opportunities for identifying the genetic targets that sexual selection may act on to shape the timing of trait expression. Furthermore, known genetic links between daily and seasonal timing mechanisms lead to the hypothesis that selection on one timescale may simultaneously also affect the other. We emphasize that studies on the timing of sexual displays of both males and females from wild populations will be invaluable for understanding the nature of sexual selection and its potential to act on differences within and between the sexes in timing. Molecular approaches will be important for pinpointing genetic components of biological rhythms that are targeted by sexual selection, and to clarify whether these represent core or peripheral components of endogenous clocks. Finally, we call for a renewed integration of the fields of evolution, behavioural ecology and chronobiology to tackle the exciting question of how sexual selection contributes to the evolution of biological clocks.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wild clocks: integrating chronobiology and ecology to understand timekeeping in free-living animals’.},

	abstract = {Insects are intimately connected to human life and well being, in both positive and negative senses. While it is estimated that insects pollinate at least two-thirds of the all food consumed by humans, malaria, a disease transmitted by the female mosquito of the Anopheles genus, kills approximately one million people per year. Due to the importance of insects to humans, researchers have developed an arsenal of mechanical, chemical, biological and educational tools to help mitigate insects' harmful effects, and to enhance their beneficial effects. However, the efficiency of such tools depends on knowing the time and location of migrations/infestations/population as early as possible. Insect detection and counting is typically performed by means of traps, usually "sticky traps", which are regularly collected and manually analyzed. The main problem is that this procedure is expensive in terms of materials and human time, and creates a lag between the time the trap is placed and inspected. This lag may only be a week, but in the case of say, mosquitoes or sand flies, this can be more than half their adult life span. We are developing an inexpensive optical sensor that uses a laser beam to detect, count and ultimately classify flying insects from distance. Our objective is to use classification techniques to provide accurate real-time counts of disease vectors down to the species/sex level. This information can be used by public health workers, government and non-government organizations to plan the optimal intervention strategies in the face of limited resources. In this work, we present some preliminary results of our research, conducted with three insect species. We show that using our simple sensor we can accurately classify these species using their wing-beat frequency as feature. We further discuss how we can augment the sensor with other sources of information in order to scale our ideas to classify a larger number of species.},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that olfactory cues from damaged and fermented fruits play important roles in resource recognition of polyphagous spotted wing Drosophila flies (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae). They are attracted to fermented sweet materials, such as decomposing fruits but also wines and vinegars, and to ubiquitous fermentation volatiles, such as acetic acid and ethanol. Gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), two-choice laboratory bioassays, and field trapping experiments were used to identify volatile compounds from wine and vinegar that are involved in SWD attraction. In addition to acetic acid and ethanol, consistent EAD responses were obtained for 13 volatile wine compounds and seven volatile vinegar compounds, with all of the vinegar EAD-active compounds also present in wine. In a field trapping experiment, the 9-component vinegar blend and 15-component wine blend were similarly attractive when compared to an acetic acid plus ethanol mixture, but were not as attractive as the wine plus vinegar mixture. In two-choice laboratory bioassays, 7 EAD-active compounds (ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl lactate, 1-hexanol, isoamyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, and ethyl sorbate), when added singly to the mixture at the same concentrations tested in the field, decreased the attraction of SWD to the mixture of acetic acid and ethanol. The blends composed of the remaining EAD-active chemicals, an 8-component wine blend [acetic acid + ethanol + acetoin + grape butyrate + methionol + isoamyl lactate + 2-phenylethanol + diethyl succinate] and a 5-component vinegar blend [acetic acid + ethanol + acetoin + grape butyrate + 2-phenylethanol] were more attractive than the acetic acid plus ethanol mixture, and as attractive as the wine plus vinegar mixture in both laboratory assays and the field trapping experiment. These results indicate that these volatiles in wine and vinegar are crucial for SWD attraction to fermented materials on which they feed as adults.},

(Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), sex pheromone are used to detect newly founded populations and estimate population density across the United States. The lures used in trapping devices are exposed to field conditions with varying climates, which can affect the rate of disparlure release. We evaluated the release rate of disparlure from delta traps baited with disparlure string dispenser from 1 to 3 yr across a broad geographic gradient, from northern Minnesota to southern North Carolina. Traps were deployed over ≈12 wk that coincided with the period of male moth flight and the deployment schedule of traps under gypsy moth management programs. We measured a uniform rate of release across all locations when considered over the accumulation of degree-days; however, due to differences in degree-day accumulation across locations, there were significant differences in release rates over time among locations. The initial lure load seemed to be sufficient regardless of climate, although rapid release of the pheromone in warmer climates could affect trap efficacy in late season. Daily rates of release in colder climates, such as Minnesota and northern Wisconsin, may not be optimal in detection efforts. This work highlights the importance of local temperatures when deploying pheromone-baited traps for monitoring a species across a large and climatically diverse landscape.},

Based on the existing literature, we suggest that the entire process of pheromonal communication, from production to behavioural response, is likely to be impacted by increases in temperature and modifications to atmospheric CO2 and O3 levels. We argue that insect species relying on long-range chemical signals will be most impacted, because these signals will likely suffer from longer exposure to oxidative gases during dispersal. We provide future directions for research programmes investigating the consequences of climate change on insect pheromonal communication.},

	abstract = {The improvement of trap-lure combinations is an important part of integrated pest management programs that involve monitoring pests for timely insecticide applications, or for their use in control strategies such as mass trapping or bait stations. In this study improvements in the capture of Drosophila suzukii were not observed following the inclusion of different color stimuli with respect to a red-black stripe cup trap. This red-black stripe trap with a hemispherical dome-shaped lid had a significantly improved physical retention of flies compared to traps fitted with a flat lid. Retention was further improved when an additional tube device, which could be baited with a supplemental attractant, was introduced through the dome-shaped lid. Under laboratory conditions, this trap, in which apple cider vinegar + 10\% ethanol was present as the drowning solution and the additional tube device was baited with a fermenting mixture of sugar and yeast, was significantly more effective in catching D. suzukii flies than other conventional attractants or a commercial lure. The capture rate of this trap-lure combination remained higher than that of a commercial lure, even after 20 days of use under laboratory conditions. In a guava orchard this trap was 15-fold more effective in catching D. suzukii flies than similar traps baited with apple cider vinegar alone, 4 to 7 fold more effective than similar traps baited with a commercial lure, and 1.7-fold more effective than a fermenting mixture of yeasts and wheat flour. In commercial blackberry orchards, this trap was 6-fold more effective in trapping D. suzukii flies than the clear trap baited with apple cider vinegar used by growers. The efficacy of this trap presents a promising line of future research for monitoring and control of D. suzukii and likely other drosophilid pests.},

The objectives of the present study were to determine the influence of decaying insects trapped in pitfalls on the attractiveness of Moura pig Sus scrofa L. (Suidae) and collared peccary Tayassu tajacu (L.) (Tayassuidae) dung used as baits to lure dung beetles, and to establish how long these baits remain attractive to dung beetles when used in these traps. Some dung beetle species seemed to be able to discriminate against foul smell from decaying insects within the first 24 h, hence decreasing trap efficiency. This was more evident in peccary dung-baited traps, which proved to be the least attractive bait. Attractiveness lasted only 24 h for peccary dung, after which it became unattractive, whereas the pig dung bait was highly attractive for 48 h, after which its attractiveness diminished but was not completely lost.},

	abstract = {Circadian clocks create a 24-hour temporal structure, which allows organisms to occupy a niche formed by time rather than space. They are pervasive throughout nature, yet they remain unexpectedly unexplored and uncharacterized in nonphotosynthetic bacteria. Here, we identify in Bacillus subtilis circadian rhythms sharing the canonical properties of circadian clocks: free-running period, entrainment, and temperature compensation. We show that gene expression in B. subtilis can be synchronized in 24-hour light or temperature cycles and exhibit phase-specific characteristics of entrainment. Upon release to constant dark and temperature conditions, bacterial biofilm populations have temperature-compensated free-running oscillations with a period close to 24 hours. Our work opens the field of circadian clocks in the free-living, nonphotosynthetic prokaryotes, bringing considerable potential for impact upon biomedicine, ecology, and industrial processes.
Bacillus subtilis has a circadian clock, extending the field of chronobiology to nonphotosynthetic bacteria.

From this, we suggest that the timekeeping functions of these organisms will be best observed and studied in their appropriate complex environments. Given the rich temporal changes that exist in these environments, it is proposed that microorganisms both adapt to and contribute to these daily dynamics through the process of temporal mutualism. Understanding the timekeeping and temporal interactions within these systems will enable a deeper understanding of circadian clocks and temporal programs and provide valuable insights for medicine and agriculture.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock controls many physiological parameters including immune response to infectious agents, which is mediated by activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. It is widely accepted that circadian regulation is based on periodic changes in gene expression that are triggered by transcriptional activity of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex. Through the use of a mouse model system we show that daily variations in the intensity of the NF-κB response to a variety of immunomodulators are mediated by core circadian protein CLOCK, which can up-regulate NF-κB–mediated transcription in the absence of BMAL1; moreover, BMAL1 counteracts the CLOCK-dependent increase in the activation of NF-κB–responsive genes. Consistent with its regulatory function, CLOCK is found in protein complexes with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, and its overexpression correlates with an increase in specific phosphorylated and acetylated transcriptionally active forms of p65. In addition, activation of NF-κB in response to immunostimuli in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and primary hepatocytes isolated from Clock-deficient mice is significantly reduced compared with WT cells, whereas Clock-Δ19 mutation, which reduces the transactivation capacity of CLOCK on E-box–containing circadian promoters, has no effect on the ability of CLOCK to up-regulate NF-κB–responsive promoters. These findings establish a molecular link between two essential determinants of the circadian and immune mechanisms, the transcription factors CLOCK and NF-κB, respectively.},

	abstract = {Many molecular, physiological and behavioural processes display distinct 24-hour rhythms that are directed by the circadian system. The master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus region of the hypothalamus, is synchronized or entrained by the light–dark cycle and, in turn, synchronizes clocks present in peripheral tissues and organs. Other environmental cues, most importantly feeding time, also synchronize peripheral clocks. In this way, the circadian system can prepare the body for predictable environmental changes such as the availability of nutrients during the normal feeding period. This Review summarizes existing knowledge about the diurnal regulation of gastrointestinal processes by circadian clocks present in the digestive tract and its accessory organs. The circadian control of gastrointestinal digestion, motility, hormones and barrier function as well as of the gut microbiota are discussed. An overview is given of the interplay between different circadian clocks in the digestive system that regulate glucose homeostasis and lipid and bile acid metabolism. Additionally, the bidirectional interaction between the master clock and peripheral clocks in the digestive system, encompassing different entraining factors, is described. Finally, the possible behavioural adjustments or pharmacological strategies for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of chronodisruption are outlined.},

In the morning, adults congregated in fields near flowering Cornus drummondi Meyer, C. racemosa Lam., and Sambucus canadensis L. where food and mates were plentiful. Around midday, as food availability declined and hygrothermal stress increased in open areas, the syrphids entered an oak-hickory forest where hygrothermal conditions were more favorable. In the afternoon, females of M. posticata and S. decora oviposited in rot cavities in trees, and males defended mating territories around these larval habitats. Adults of M. posticata performed the same behaviors at artificial oviposition sites that were placed in the forest understory. On days when the temperature in the forest exceeded 29Â°C, the activity curve of both sexes of M. posticata changed from unimodal to bimodal, the afternoon lull corresponding to the hottest part of the day. The overall behavior of these 6 syrphids may have been selected in response to food availability, hygrothermal stress, and mating success.},

Most species are active under similar conditions of light intensity, but a shade-tolerant (Melanostoma scalare Fabr.) and a sun-loving species (Metasyrphus corollae Fabr.) were identified. 3. Large species become active (i.e. move, by flying or feeding) at lower temperatures than small ones, except M.scalare, which is tolerant to cool temperatures. This means that, M.scalare apart, the order of species appearing during the day is size-dependent, largest first. 4. Previous claims about the diel periodicity of syrphids can be reconciled by considering the importance of individual thermal balance. 5. Tolerance to low temperatures in small hoverflies is associated with feeding on anemophilous pollen; this may indicate a proline-fuelled flight.},

In addition, the results of the trap captures were compared with the direct D-VAC sampling in one sesame field. The diurnal activity was monitored over three successive days, 28–30 August, and again on 15 September by yellow sticky traps that were changed every two hours for most of the day and replaced every half hour between 05.30 h and 07.30 h and 17.30 h and 19.30 h. The yellow-trap sampling revealed consistent seasonal activity patterns associated with both the first and second crop, characterized by a secondary maximum within the first 30 days and an absolute maximum between day 52 and 73 after sowing. Males made up {\textgreater} 85\% of the sticky-trap catches while females were better represented in the D-VAC collections (74\%). The diel activity was greatest between 17.30 h and 19.30 h and most concentrated within a 30 min period just before sunset. Very few individuals were captured during hours of high light intensity and during the night. During the period of greatest activity only males were trapped.},

Data were collected on numbers of arthropods caught in pitfall traps and on sticky cards. The long-legged flies (Diptera: Dolichopodidae) and thrips (Thysanoptera) collected were consistently diurnal, while ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), springtails (Collembola: Entomobryidae), micro-Diptera and tumbling flower beetles (Coleoptera: Mordellidae) were diurnal in one experiment. Elateridae and Aphididae tended to be nocturnal taxa, but plant height had some effect as well because aphid numbers were significantly higher in tall (182.3 cm) sunn hemp than in short (88.1 cm) sunn hemp at night time only. Cicadellidae were active during both day and night time and showed different levels of activity in pitfall traps and on sticky cards. Pitfall traps were found to be very effective for sampling insect taxa including Formicidae, Elateridae, and Collembola, while micro-Diptera, thrips, aphids, and Mordellidae were commonly caught on sticky cards. Cicadellidae and Dolichopodidae were commonly recovered in pitfall traps and on sticky cards.

We analysed 271 pinned specimens representing two genera and at least 36 species. Due to the age of our material, we targeted overlapping DNA fragments ranging in size from 94 to 407 bp. We were able to recover valid sequences from 215 specimens, of which 18\% had 500- to 658-bp barcodes, 36\% had 201- to 499-bp barcodes and 46\% had 65- to 200-bp barcodes. Our study demonstrates the importance of choosing suitable primers when dealing with older specimens and shows that even very short sequences can be diagnostically informative provided that an appropriate gene region is used. Our study also highlights the lack of knowledge surrounding blackfly taxonomy, and we briefly discuss the need for further phylogenetic studies in this socioeconomically important family of insects.},

	abstract = {Background DNA barcoding, the analysis of sequence variation in the 5′ region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene, has been shown to provide an efficient method for the identification of species in a wide range of animal taxa. In order to assess the effectiveness of barcodes in the discrimination of Heteroptera, we examined 344 species belonging to 178 genera, drawn from specimens in the Canadian National Collection of Insects. Methodology/Principal Findings Analysis of the COI gene revealed less than 2\% intra-specific divergence in 90\% of the taxa examined, while minimum interspecific distances exceeded 3\% in 77\% of congeneric species pairs. Instances where barcodes fail to distinguish species represented clusters of morphologically similar species, except one case of barcode identity between species in different genera. Several instances of deep intraspecific divergence were detected suggesting possible cryptic species. Conclusions/Significance Although this analysis encompasses 0.8\% of the described global fauna, our results indicate that DNA barcodes will aid the identification of Heteroptera. This advance will be useful in pest management, regulatory and environmental applications and will also reveal species that require further taxonomic research.},

	abstract = {Because many animal species are undescribed, and because the identification of known species is often difficult, interim taxonomic nomenclature has often been used in biodiversity analysis. By assigning individuals to presumptive species, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), these systems speed investigations into the patterning of biodiversity and enable studies that would otherwise be impossible. Although OTUs have conventionally been separated through their morphological divergence, DNA-based delineations are not only feasible, but have important advantages. OTU designation can be automated, data can be readily archived, and results can be easily compared among investigations. This study exploits these attributes to develop a persistent, species-level taxonomic registry for the animal kingdom based on the analysis of patterns of nucleotide variation in the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. It begins by examining the correspondence between groups of specimens identified to a species through prior taxonomic work and those inferred from the analysis of COI sequence variation using one new (RESL) and four established (ABGD, CROP, GMYC, jMOTU) algorithms. It subsequently describes the implementation, and structural attributes of the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system. Aside from a pragmatic role in biodiversity assessments, BINs will aid revisionary taxonomy by flagging possible cases of synonymy, and by collating geographical information, descriptive metadata, and images for specimens that are likely to belong to the same species, even if it is undescribed. More than 274,000 BIN web pages are now available, creating a biodiversity resource that is positioned for rapid growth.},

	abstract = {Light discrimination according to colour can confer survival advantages by guiding animals towards food and shelter and away from potentially harmful situations1,2. Such colour-dependent behaviour can be learned or innate. Data on innate colour preference in mammals remain controversial3 and there are limited data for simpler organisms4–7. Here we show that, when given a choice among blue, green and dim light, fruit flies exhibit an unexpectedly complex pattern of colour preference that changes according to the time of day. Flies show a strong preference for green in the early morning and late afternoon, a reduced green preference at midday and a robust avoidance of blue throughout the day. Genetic manipulations reveal that the peaks in green preference require rhodopsin-based visual photoreceptors and are controlled by the circadian clock. The midday reduction in green preference in favour of dim light depends on the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels dTRPA1 and Pyrexia, and is also timed by the clock. By contrast, avoidance of blue light is primarily mediated by multidendritic neurons, requires rhodopsin 7 and the TRP channel Painless, and is independent of the clock. Our findings show that several TRP channels are involved in colour-driven behaviour in Drosophila, and reveal distinct pathways of innate colour preference that coordinate the behavioural dynamics of flies in ambient light.},

Samples were collected from 810 sample runs carried out over 52 d and contained 7,095 Culicoides of which more than half (50.3\%) were identified as Culicoides obsoletus Meigen by using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. Other commonly encountered species included Culicoides scoticus Downes \&amp; Kettle (14.7\% of total Culicoides caught), Culicoides dewulfi Goetghebuer (3.7\%), and Culicoides chiopterus Meigen (4.2\%). The activity rates of these species were examined with regard to both meteorological factors (light intensity, humidity, temperature, and wind speed and direction) and other potentially contributing variables (lunar phase and brightness, sunset time, and year) by using generalized linear models. All the species examined were collected in greater abundance at sunset, although the relationship between underlying light intensity and numbers was less pronounced in C. dewulfi and C. chiopterus. Collections of Culicoides were reduced at temperatures above 21°C and were inversely related to wind speed. Variation between species was recorded, however, in response to wind direction: C. dewulfi and C. chiopterus were associated with prevailing winds passing through fields containing livestock, whereas C. obsoletus and C. scoticus demonstrated no such relationship. A male:female ratio of 1:3.56 was observed in catches, and male populations were protandrous. These results are discussed with reference both to the ecology of these species and methods currently used to predict adult Culicoides movement and abundance in Europe.},

	abstract = {The abundance, activity and species richness of arthropods, particularly of insect herbivores, were investigated in the upper canopy and understorey of a lowland rainforest at La Makandé, Gabon. In total 14 161 arthropods were collected with beating, flight interception and sticky traps, from six canopy sites, during the day and at night, from mid-January to mid-March 1999. The effects of stratum were most important, representing between 40 and 70\% of the explained variance in arthropod distribution. Site effects represented between 20 and 40\% of the variance and emphasized the néed for replication of sampling among canopy sites. Time effects (diel activity) explained a much lower percentage of variance (6–9\%). The density and abundance of many arthropod taxa and species were significantly higher in the upper canopy than in the understorey. Arthropod activity was also higher during the day than at night. In particular, insect herbivores were 2.5 times more abundant and twice as speciose in the upper canopy than in the understorey, a probable response to the greater and more diverse food resources in the former stratum. Faunal overlap between the upper canopy and understorey was low. The most dissimilar herbivore communities foraged in the understorey at night and the upper canopy during the day. Further, a taxonomic study of a species-rich genus of herbivore collected there (Agrilus, Coleoptera Buprestidae) confirmed that the fauna of the upper canopy was different, diverse and very poorly known in comparison to that of the understorey. Herbivore turnover between day and night was rather high in the upper canopy and no strong influx of insect herbivores from lower foliage to the upper canopy was detected at night. This suggests that insect herbivores of the upper canopy may be resident and well adapted to environmental conditions there.},

Compared to the compound eye of the worker honeybee Apis mellifera and the diurnal halictid bee Lasioglossum leucozonium, the eye of M. genalis shows specific retinal and optical adaptations for vision in dim light. The major anatomical adaptations within the eye of the nocturnal bee are (1) nearly twofold larger ommatidial facets and (2) a 4–5 times wider rhabdom diameter than found in the diurnal bees studied. Optically, the apposition eye of M. genalis is 27 times more sensitive to light than the eyes of the diurnal bees. This increased optical sensitivity represents a clear optical adaptation to low light intensities. Although this unique nocturnal apposition eye has a greatly improved ability to catch light, a 27-fold increase in sensitivity alone cannot account for nocturnal vision at light intensities that are 8 log units dimmer than during daytime. New evidence suggests that additional neuronal spatial summation within the first optic ganglion, the lamina, is involved.},

The gynandromorph showed a deviant activity pattern; it was intermediate between that of the male and female M. amoena. Our results imply that the brains of bilateral gynandromorphs may have mixed sex-specific signaling.

Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},

	abstract = {The impacts of the changing climate on the biological world vary across latitudes, habitats and spatial scales. By contrast, the time of day at which these changes are occurring has received relatively little attention. As biologically significant organismal activities often occur at particular times of day, any asymmetry in the rate of change between the daytime and night-time will skew the climatic pressures placed on them, and this could have profound impacts on the natural world. Here we determine global spatial variation in the difference in the mean annual rate at which near-surface daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperatures and mean daytime and mean night-time cloud cover, specific humidity and precipitation have changed over land. For the years 1983–2017, we derived hourly climate data and assigned each hour as occurring during daylight or darkness. In regions that showed warming asymmetry of {\textgreater}0.5°C (equivalent to mean surface temperature warming during the 20th century) we investigated corresponding changes in cloud cover, specific humidity and precipitation. We then examined the proportional change in leaf area index (LAI) as one potential biological response to diel warming asymmetry. We demonstrate that where night-time temperatures increased by {\textgreater}0.5°C more than daytime temperatures, cloud cover, specific humidity and precipitation increased. Conversely, where daytime temperatures increased by {\textgreater}0.5°C more than night-time temperatures, cloud cover, specific humidity and precipitation decreased. Driven primarily by increased cloud cover resulting in a dampening of daytime temperatures, over twice the area of land has experienced night-time warming by {\textgreater}0.25°C more than daytime warming, and has become wetter, with important consequences for plant phenology and species interactions. Conversely, greater daytime relative to night-time warming is associated with hotter, drier conditions, increasing species vulnerability to heat stress and water budgets. This was demonstrated by a divergent response of LAI to warming asymmetry.},

Here, we characterize diel (observed under light:dark conditions) time-of-day changes in metabolic detoxification and resistance to insecticide challenge in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. A better understanding of mosquito chronobiology will yield insights into developing novel control strategies for this important disease vector. We have previously identified {\textgreater}2000 rhythmically expressed An. gambiae genes. These include metabolic detoxification enzymes peaking at various times throughout the day. Especially interesting was the identification of rhythmic genes encoding enzymes capable of pyrethroid and/or DDT metabolism (CYP6M2, CYP6P3, CYP6Z1, and GSTE2). We hypothesized that these temporal changes in gene expression would confer time-of-day specific changes in metabolic detoxification and responses to insecticide challenge. An. gambiae mosquitoes (adult female Pimperena and Mali-NIH strains) were tested by gene expression analysis for diel rhythms in key genes associated with insecticidal resistance. Biochemical assays for total GST, esterase, and oxidase enzymatic activities were undertaken on time-specific mosquito head and body protein lysates. To determine for rhythmic susceptibility to insecticides by survivorship, mosquitoes were exposed to DDT or deltamethrin across the diel cycle. We report the occurrence of temporal changes in GST activity in samples extracted from the body and head with a single peak at late-night to dawn, but no rhythms were detected in oxidase or esterase activity. The Pimperena strain was found to be resistant to insecticidal challenge, and subsequent genomic analysis revealed the presence of the resistance-conferring kdr mutation. We observed diel rhythmicity in key insecticide detoxification genes in the Mali-NIH strain, with peak phases as previously reported in the Pimperena strain. The insecticide sensitive Mali-NIH strain mosquitoes exhibited a diel rhythm in survivorship to DDT exposure and a bimodal variation to deltamethrin challenge. Our results demonstrate rhythms in detoxification and pesticide susceptibility in An. gambiae mosquitoes; this knowledge could be incorporated into mosquito control and experimental design strategies, and contributes to our basic understanding of mosquito biology.},

	abstract = {Many insect species display daily variation of sensitivity to insecticides when they are exposed to the same concentration at different times during the day. To date, this has not been investigated in bed bugs. To address this, we explored circadian rhythms in insecticide susceptibility, xenobiotic metabolizing (XM) gene expressions, and metabolic detoxification in the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius. An insecticide susceptible Monheim strain of C. lectularius was most tolerant of deltamethrin during the late photophase at ZT9 (i.e. nine hours after light is present in the light-dark cycle (LD) cycle) and similarly repeated at CT9 (i.e. nine hours into the subjective day in constant darkness (DD)) suggesting endogenous circadian involvement in susceptibility to deltamethrin. No diel rhythm was observed against imidacloprid insecticide despite significant daily susceptibility in both LD and DD conditions. Rhythmic expressions of metabolic detoxification genes, GSTs1 and CYP397A1 displayed similar expression patterns with total GST and P450 enzyme activities in LD and DD conditions, respectively. The oscillation of mRNA levels of GSTs1 and CYP397A1 was found consistent with peak phases of deltamethrin susceptibility in C. lectularius. This study demonstrates that circadian patterns of metabolic detoxification gene expression occur within C. lectularius. As a consequence, insecticide efficacy can vary dramatically throughout a 24 hour period.},

	abstract = {Almost all organisms on earth are adapted to anticipate daily environmental cycles and synchronize with these approximately 24-h rhythms by a circadian clock system. Given its importance to organismal success, the field of chronobiology is rapidly expanding unraveling the complex and integral role circadian clocks play. In applied science, these new insights have led to major advances mainly in the field of medicine. In the field of plant rearing and livestock management, the importance of circadian clocks is already acknowledged. Integrating circadian clocks in insect pest management has mainly received theoretical attention. Applying theory to practice is likely delayed because of the difficulty in managing an open environment. The storage environment is easier to control and therefore basic ideas of integrating circadian clocks to pest management could be applied. A cardinal difficulty in storage management is that storage insects develop resistance to common pesticides. This difficulty can be addressed by various manipulations of the insect's chronobiology. In this review, I discuss the various clock-driven behavioural, physiological and genomic processes that might be considered as sensitive targets for agro-chronobiology control. I further suggest that to promote the discipline of agro-chronobiology, the contribution of previous and current studies to the two following approaches in agro-chronobiology should be examined: 1) treating the vulnerable phases of the circadian clock, and 2) distorting the circadian clock system.},

	abstract = {Many biological processes and behaviors in mosquitoes display rhythmic patterns, allowing for fine tuning to cyclic environmental conditions. In mosquitoes, vector-host interactions are primarily mediated by olfactory signals. Previous studies have established that, in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, rhythmic expression of odorant binding proteins and takeout proteins in the antenna resulted in a corresponding rhythm in olfactory sensitivity to relevant host odors. However, it remained unclear how rhythms observed in olfactory sensitivity affect or explain rhythms in behavioral output, which ultimately impacts disease transmission. In order to address this knowledge gap, we quantified and compared patterns in locomotor activity, olfactory sensitivity, and olfactory behaviors in adult female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Here, we demonstrate an odorant-specific modulation of olfactory sensitivity in Ae. aegypti, decoupled from rhythms in olfactory behavior. Additionally, behavioral assays performed herein represent the first evidence of a time-dependence of the olfactory activation of behavior in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Results suggest that olfactory behavior of Aedes mosquitoes is modulated at both the peripheral (antenna) and central levels. As such, this work serves as a foundation for future studies aimed at further understanding the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity.},

	abstract = {Pollination biology at the community level was investigated using quantitative techniques, comparative methodology, measurements of the physical habitat, and consideration of floral characteristics. The frequency of insect visits to flowers was investigated in three contrasting communities: a deciduous woodland-meadow site in eastern Massachusetts, alpine tundra in New Hampshire, and Mediterranean scrub (fynbos) in South Africa. Visits to flowers were most common in woodland-meadow, followed by alpine tundra, and least frequent in fynbos. Bees were the most common visitor in the woodland-meadow and the fynbos, but flies were the most common visitor in the tundra. Flower color often influenced visitation rates and had a weak but significant effect on the type of insect that visited flowers. Preferences for color by different types of insects often changed in different communities, which suggests that floral syndromes may be community-specific. In all communities, tubular flowers were visited less often than open flowers. Less specialized insects were more common on open than tubular flowers, but large variances made few differences statistically significant. Combining measurements of temperature, light, humidity, wind speed, time of day, and season (using cluster analysis) with the shape of a flower, it was predicted that a 10-minute observation would include at least one visit. Flower shape, temperature, light, and season appear to be the most important variables influencing insect visitation rates. Results of this study indicate that relationships between insects and flowers are nonspecific and vary among communities.},

Seasonal variation was a key parameter in metacommunity structure and population dynamics. In contrast, day and night periods and climatic factors had a low importance for most of the response variables, apart from richness that was negatively influenced by temperature. Concerning the population dynamics, time period plays an important role in predator species, but not in phytophagous species. Our results showed that phytophagous mites remain on leaves during both periods, whereas predators seemed to have partitioned their habitat, since some species had a tendency to forage on leaves during the day, while others forage at night. Our finding can be an indicative of behavioural response to intraguild predation or competition. In terms of metacommunity structure and dynamics, sampling period seemed not to affect species composition since we recorded higher turnover rates among trees than between periods in a same tree.},

T. infestans oriented towards airstreams enriched with carbon dioxide exhibiting a threshold response between 300 and 400 p.p.m. above the ambient CO2 background. The accuracy of the oriented response to carbon dioxide improved with stimulus intensity. Remarkably, insects did not show any change in their sensitivity threshold to carbon dioxide with the starvation time. The attractiveness to carbon dioxide depended on the time of the day, i.e. these nocturnal bugs only oriented towards carbon dioxide-loaded airstreams during the first hours of the scotophase. l-lactic acid did not evoke oriented responses when it was presented as a single stimulus in a wide range of intensities. However, a marked synergism was evident when l-lactic acid was combined with a sub-threshold concentration of carbon dioxide. Under this condition, the threshold response to carbon dioxide decreased to 75–150 p.p.m. above ambient CO2 background. The isomer d-lactic acid evoked no response, either alone or in combination with carbon dioxide. When insects were stimulated with 1-octen-3-ol a significant positive orientation was found. This response was not modified by the addition of carbon dioxide.},

	abstract = {The cockroach Rhyparobia (Leucophaea) maderae expresses a circadian rhythm in pheromone-dependent mating activity that peaks at the late day/early night. In contrast, the circadian rhythm in olfactory sensitivity of the Madeira cockroach is at its minimum during this time. Until now, the reasons for this obvious discrepancy in phase were not understood. Previously, it was shown that cyclic nucleotides modulate olfactory sensitivity in a zeitgeber time (ZT)-dependent manner. In moths' olfactory receptor neurons, adapting pheromone concentrations elevate cGMP levels, which decrease pheromone sensitivity. In contrast, cAMP elevations sensitized pheromone responses. Thus, with immunoassay kits, it was determined whether cAMP and cGMP baseline levels vary in a ZT-dependent manner in antennal lysates of female R. maderae, revealing underlying circadian rhythms in olfactory sensitivity. Furthermore, it was examined whether adapting pheromone exposure elevates cGMP levels in cockroach antennae, possibly overshadowing underlying circadian rhythms in sensitivity via sensory adaptation. It was shown for the first time that cAMP and cGMP baseline levels oscillate in antiphase in a ZT-dependent manner in an insect's antenna, with the maximum in cAMP concentrations coinciding with maximal mating activity during the late day. Moreover, the cAMP baseline level oscillation expressed a circadian rhythm since it persisted under constant darkness in contrast to cGMP baseline levels. Furthermore, while excess exposure to male pheromones increased cGMP and decreased cAMP baseline levels, the stress hormone octopamine increased adenylyl cyclase activity at all ZTs tested. Therefore, it is suggested that cyclic nucleotide-dependent modulation of olfactory sensitivity due to olfactory overstimulation and stress could be responsible for previously measured phase discrepancies between rhythms in mating behavior and pheromone sensitivity.},

When 1-day-old moths were transferred to a shifted LD cycle with lights turned off 4 h earlier, male behavioral responses to the pheromone advanced in time accordingly by 4 h. This showed that male behavioral responses to the pheromone are under the control of an endogenous oscillator. To further examine the level at which the circadian rhythm of the male behavioral response is regulated, the authors tested the olfactory responses of male antennal receptors to pheromone stimuli by means of electroantennograms (EAG) at different times of day. No significant variation in the sensitivity of the male antennal response to the pheromone was observed in terms of time of day.

Trap colour (yellow and green) was also tested for beneficial Hymenoptera and Diptera. The Unitraps and cross-vane Unitraps were the most effective trap types, but the latter trap that contained glycol solution was less effective than a dry trap. Trap colour did not have any effect on the catches of D. pini, but yellow Unitraps captured more Diptera (Phoridae and Tachinidae) and Hymenoptera (Pteromalidae, Ceraphronidae and Braconidae) than green traps. In contrast, the egg parasitoid Telenomus tetratomus preferred green traps. Overall catches of beneficial insects were relatively low, except Phoridae.

Circadian biology is becoming a critical factor for improving drug efficacy and diminishing drug toxicity. Indeed, there is emerging evidence showing that some drugs are more effective at nighttime than daytime, whereas for others it is the opposite. This suggests that the biology of the target cell will determine how an organ will respond to a drug at a specific time of the day, thus modulating pharmacodynamics. Thus, it is now time that circadian factors become an integral part of translational research.},

Circadian rhythms play a fundamental role in homeostasis as they ensure coordination between the environment and an organism's behavior and physiology. This coordination is called entrainment. Entrainment depends on environmental cues known as zeitgebers. Human zeitgebers include light (primary zeitgeber), sleep, eating, exercise, and activity. Circadian rhythms are disrupted in critically-ill patients due to both critical illness and current intensive care unit (ICU) practices. Disruptions in circadian rhythms are tightly linked with ICU sleep disruption. Together these entities potentiate numerous adverse outcomes including delirium, metabolic derangements, cardiovascular instability, and immune compromise. Herein, we will highlight potential areas for care improvement via chronobundles. We suggest bright light during the day, maintaining darkness, and protecting sleep at night, intermittent rather than continuous feeds, and activity via mobilization during the day. Optimizing circadian rhythms is a low-risk intervention that is underutilized in current ICU practice. This optimization could be a powerful tool in helping to improve outcomes in the critically-ill patient.},

However, there are increasing concerns that larger, more connected crop fields and loss of seminatural areas exacerbate pest pressure, but findings to date have been inconclusive. Even less is known about whether increased pest pressure results in measurable effects for farmers, such as increased insecticide use and decreased crop yield. Using extensive spatiotemporal data sampled every 2 to 3 d throughout five growing seasons in 373 cotton fields, we show that pests immigrated earlier and were more likely to occur in larger cotton fields embedded in landscapes with little seminatural area ({\textless}10\%). Earlier pest immigration resulted in earlier spraying that was further linked to more sprays per season. Importantly, crop yield was the lowest in these intensified landscapes. Our results demonstrate that both environmental conservation and production objectives can be achieved in conventional agriculture by decreasing field sizes and maintaining seminatural vegetation in the surrounding landscapes.},

Recent research has explored practices that conserve natural-enemy communities and reduce pest outbreaks, revealing that different components of agroecosystems can influence natural-enemy populations. In this review, we consider a range of disturbances that influence pest control provided by natural enemies and how conservation practices can mitigate or counteract disturbance. We use four case studies to illustrate how conservation and disturbance mitigation increase the potential for biological control and provide co-benefits for the broader agroecosystem. To facilitate the adoption of conservation practices that improve top-down control across significant areas of the landscape, these practices will need to provide multifunctional benefits, but should be implemented with natural enemies explicitly in mind.},

Here, we conclude that the spread and intensification of agriculture during the past half century is directly related to these losses. In addition, many areas, including tropical mountains, are suffering serious losses because of climate change as well. Crops currently occupy about 11\% of the world’s land surface, with active grazing taking place over an additional 30\%. The industrialization of agriculture during the second half of the 20th century involved farming on greatly expanded scales, monoculturing, the application of increasing amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, and the elimination of interspersed hedgerows and other wildlife habitat fragments, all practices that are destructive to insect and other biodiversity in and near the fields. Some of the insects that we are destroying, including pollinators and predators of crop pests, are directly beneficial to the crops. In the tropics generally, natural vegetation is being destroyed rapidly and often replaced with export crops such as oil palm and soybeans. To mitigate the effects of the Sixth Mass Extinction event that we have caused and are experiencing now, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live, will be necessary.},

Despite the worrying implications of these papers, all studies on global insect extinction to date clearly reflect the Prestonian shortfall, the general lack of knowledge on the abundance of species and their trends in space and time. Data currently available concerning global insect abundance trends invariably suffer from phylogenetic, functional, habitat, spatial and temporal bias. Here, we suggest that to follow the real global changes in insect (and all other taxa) communities, biases or shortcomings in data collection must be avoided. An optimised scheme would maximise phylogenetic, functional, habitat, spatial and temporal coverage with minimum investment. Standardised sampling would provide primary data, on a first step in the form of abundance and biomass. Individuals would then be identified to species level whenever possible, with a morphospecies approach or genetics serving as intermediate steps, complementing or even final steps for non-described species. If standardised abundance and ecological data can be readily made available, biodiversity trends can be tracked in real time and allow us to predict and prevent an impending global insect apocalypse.},

Journals are justifiably concerned with grammar but do not show the same rigour about another step crucial to biological research: specimen identification. Surveying the author guidelines of 100 journals, we found that only 6\% of them request explicitly citation of the literature used in specimen identification. Authors hamper readers from contesting specimen identification whenever vouchers, identification methods, and taxon concepts are not provided. However, unclear taxonomic procedures violate the basic scientific principle of reproducibility. The scientific community must continuously look for practical alternatives to improve taxonomic identification and taxonomic verification. We argue that voucher pictures are an accessible, cheap and time-effective alternative to mitigate (not abolish) bad taxonomy by exposing preventable misidentifications. Voucher pictures allow scientists to judge specimen identification actively, based on available data. The popularization of high-quality image devices, photo-identification technologies and computer vision algorithms yield accurate scientific photo-documentation, improving taxonomic procedures. Taxonomy is timeless, transversal and essential to most scientific disciplines in biological sciences. It is time to demand rigour in taxonomic identifications.},

	abstract = {Bees exemplify flights under bright sunlight. A few species across bee families have evolved nocturnality, displaying remarkable adaptations to overcome limitations of their daylight-suited apposition eyes. Phase inversion to nocturnality in a minority of bees that co-exist with diurnal bees provides a unique opportunity to study ecological benefits that mediate total temporal niche shifts. While floral traits and sensory modalities associated with the evolution of classical nocturnal pollination syndromes, e.g. by bats and moths, are well-studied, nocturnality in bees represents a poorly understood, recently invaded, extreme niche. To test the competitive release hypothesis, we examine how nocturnality shapes foraging by comparing pollen loads, nest pollen, and flower visitation of sympatric nocturnal and diurnal carpenter bees. We predicted that nocturnal bees primarily use night-blooming flowers, show little/no resource overlap with diurnal species and competitive release favors night-time pollen collection for provisioning. Contrarily, we found substantial resource overlap between nocturnal and diurnal bees. Flower opening times, floral longevity and plant abundance did not define nocturnal flower use. Smaller pollen loads on nocturnal foragers suggest subsistence on resource leftovers largely from diurnal flowers. Greater pollen types/diversity on nocturnal foragers indicate lower floral constancy compared to diurnal congenerics. Reduced activity during new moon compared to full moon suggests constraints to nocturnal foraging. Invasion and sustenance within the nocturnal niche is characterized by: (i) opportunistic foraging on residual resources as indicated by smaller pollen loads, extensive utilization of day-blooming flowers and substantial overlap with diurnal bees, (ii) generalization at two levels—between and within foraging trips as indicated by lower floral constancy, (iii) reduced foraging on darker nights, indicating visual constraints despite sensitive optics. This together with smaller populations and univoltine breeding in nocturnal compared to multivoltine diurnal counterparts suggest that nocturnality imposes substantial fitness costs. In conclusion, the evolution of nocturnality in bees is accompanied by resource generalization instead of specialization. Reduced floral constancy suggests differences in foraging strategies of nocturnal and diurnal bees which merits further investigation. The relative roles of competition, floral rewards and predators should be examined to fully understand the evolution and maintenance of nocturnality in bees.},

	abstract = {Foraging on flowers in low light at dusk and dawn comes at an additional cost for insect pollinators with diurnal vision. Nevertheless, some species are known to be frequently active at these times. To explore how early and under which light levels colonies of bumblebees, Bombus terrestris, initiate their foraging activity, we tracked foragers of different body sizes using RFID over 5 consecutive days during warm periods of the flowering season. Bees that left the colony at lower light levels and earlier in the day were larger in size. This result extends the evidence for alloethism in bumblebees and shows that foragers differ in their task specialization depending on body size. By leaving the colony earlier to find and exploit flowers in low light, larger-sized foragers are aided by their more sensitive eyes and can effectively increase their contributions to the colony's food influx. The decision to leave the colony early seems to be further facilitated by knowledge about profitable food resources in specific locations. We observed that experience accrued over many foraging flights determined whether a bee started foraging under lower light levels and earlier in the morning. Larger-sized bees were not more experienced than smaller-sized bees, confirming earlier observations of wide size ranges among active foragers. Overall, we found that most foragers left at higher light levels when they could see well and fly faster. Nevertheless, a small proportion of foragers left the colony shortly after the onset of dawn when light levels were below 10 lux. Our observations suggest that bumblebee colonies have the potential to balance the benefits of deploying large-sized or experienced foragers during dawn against the risks and costs of foraging under low light by regulating the onset of their activity at different stages of the colony's life cycle and in changing environmental conditions.},

Although, there is compelling experimental evidence that foraging behavior is guided by the circadian clock, nothing is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we present for the first time a study that explores whether time-restricted foraging under natural light-dark (LD) condition affects the molecular clock in honey bees. Food was presented in an enclosed flight chamber (12 m × 4 m × 4 m) either for 2 hours in the morning or 2 hours in the afternoon for several consecutive days and daily cycling of the two major clock genes, cryptochrome2 (cry2) and period (per), were analyzed for three different parts of the nervous system involved in feeding-related behaviors: brain, subesophageal ganglion (SEG), and the antennae with olfactory sensory neurons. We found that morning and afternoon trained foragers showed significant phase differences in the cycling of both clock genes in all three tissues. In addition, the phase differences were more pronounced when the feeder was scented with the common plant odor, linalool. Together our findings suggest that foraging time may function as a Zeitgeber that might have the capability to modulate the light entrained molecular clock.},

Recent studies show that the circadian clock acts as a strategic planner to prime active defense responses towards the morning or daytime when conditions, such as the opening of stomata required for photosynthesis, are favorable for attackers. Execution of the defense response, on the other hand, is determined according to the cellular redox state and is regulated in part by the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species upon pathogen challenge. The interplay between redox and the circadian clock further gates the onset of defense response to a specific time of the day to avoid conflict with growth-related activities. In this review, we focus on discussing the roles of the circadian clock as a robust overseer and the cellular redox as a dynamic executor of plant defense.},

Our method relies on jointly learning a feature-extracting network and a set of class representations, or prototypes, which incorporate the error metric into their relative arrangement in the embedding space. Our approach allows for consistent improvement of the severity of the network’s errors with regard to the cost matrix. Furthermore, when the induced metric contains insight on the data structure, our approach improves the overall precision as well. Experiments on four different public datasets—from agricultural time series classiﬁcation to depth image semantic segmentation—validate our approach.},

	abstract = {Insights into animal behaviour play an increasingly central role in species-focused conservation practice. However, progress towards incorporating behaviour into regional or global conservation strategies has been more limited, not least because standardized datasets of behavioural traits are generally lacking at wider taxonomic or spatial scales. Here we make use of the recent expansion of global datasets for birds to assess the prospects for including behavioural traits in systematic conservation priority-setting and monitoring programmes. Using International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List classifications for more than 9500 bird species, we show that the incidence of threat can vary substantially across different behavioural categories, and that some types of behaviour—including particular foraging, mating and migration strategies—are significantly more threatened than others. The link between behavioural traits and extinction risk is partly driven by correlations with well-established geographical and ecological factors (e.g. range size, body mass, human population pressure), but our models also reveal that behaviour modifies the effect of these factors, helping to explain broad-scale patterns of extinction risk. Overall, these results suggest that a multi-species approach at the scale of communities, continents and ecosystems can be used to identify and monitor threatened behaviours, and to flag up cases of latent extinction risk, where threatened status may currently be underestimated. Our findings also highlight the importance of comprehensive standardized descriptive data for ecological and behavioural traits, and point the way towards deeper integration of behaviour into quantitative conservation assessments.

	abstract = {The impact of environmental change on the reproduction and survival of wildlife is often behaviourally mediated, placing behavioural ecology in a central position to quantify population- and community-level consequences of anthropogenic threats to biodiversity. This theme issue demonstrates how recent conceptual and methodological advances in the discipline are applied to inform conservation. The issue highlights how the focus in behavioural ecology on understanding variation in behaviour between individuals, rather than just measuring the population mean, is critical to explaining demographic stochasticity and thereby reducing fuzziness of population models. The contributions also show the importance of knowing the mechanisms by which behaviour is achieved, i.e. the role of learning, reasoning and instincts, in order to understand how behaviours change in human-modified environments, where their function is less likely to be adaptive. More recent work has thus abandoned the ‘adaptationist’ paradigm of early behavioural ecology and increasingly measures evolutionary processes directly by quantifying selection gradients and phenotypic plasticity. To support quantitative predictions at the population and community levels, a rich arsenal of modelling techniques has developed, and interdisciplinary approaches show promising prospects for predicting the effectiveness of alternative management options, with the social sciences, movement ecology and epidemiology particularly pertinent. The theme issue furthermore explores the relevance of behaviour for global threat assessment, and practical advice is given as to how behavioural ecologists can augment their conservation impact by carefully selecting and promoting their study systems, and increasing their engagement with local communities, natural resource managers and policy-makers. Its aim to uncover the nuts and bolts of how natural systems work positions behavioural ecology squarely in the heart of conservation biology, where its perspective offers an all-important complement to more descriptive ‘big-picture’ approaches to priority setting.

	abstract = {The concept of biodiversity embraces a multifaceted and hierarchical analysis of the complexity of life, with implications in many areas of science, philosophy, ethics, politics and even religion. Three levels are included in the commonly accepted definitions: genetical, species and ecosystem diversity, going from the intraspecific level to the landscape. Here I argue that a fourth level, never included in biodiversity studies, is of prominent relevance: ethological diversity or “ethodiversity”. There is a growing number of studies describing alternative behaviours, behavioural plasticity, learning and even personality, as characteristics of animal populations or individuals. Ethodiversity is also relevant in unravelling cryptic biodiversity, such as species that differ in their behaviour but are otherwise undistinguishable. Maintaining ethodiversity is therefore essential in conservation, and cannot be achieved simply by focusing on genetic diversity. Behaviour has profound ecological consequences, particularly in species interactions, and is a crucial element in the adaptability of animals to new environments. Ethodiversity is important at the intraspecific, inter-population, and species level and has practical relevance in several fields, like captive breeding, eco-novelty and popular science. Finally, I expect ethodiversity to show a latitudinal cline, with more diverse and elaborate behaviours per species in the tropical regions, given the increase in interactions near the equator.},

However, research efforts toward low-power sensing devices with fully functional machine learning (ML) on-board are still fragmented and limited in smart farming. Biotic stress is one of the primary causes of crop yield reduction. With the development of deep learning in computer vision technology, autonomous detection of pest infestation through images has become an important research direction for timely crop disease diagnosis. This paper presents an embedded system enhanced with ML functionalities, ensuring continuous detection of pest infestation inside fruit orchards. The embedded solution is based on a low-power embedded sensing system along with a Neural Accelerator able to capture and process images inside common pheromone-based traps. Three different ML algorithms have been trained and deployed, highlighting the capabilities of the platform. Moreover, the proposed approach guarantees an extended battery life thanks to the integration of energy harvesting functionalities. Results show how it is possible to automate the task of pest infestation for unlimited time without the farmer’s intervention.},

However, in machine-learning-based image classification we typically infer an object’s class from just a single image showing an object. Especially for challenging classification problems, the visual information conveyed by a single image may be insufficient for an accurate decision. We propose a classification scheme that relies on fusing visual information captured through images depicting the same object from multiple perspectives. Convolutional neural networks are used to extract and encode visual features from the multiple views and we propose strategies for fusing these information. More specifically, we investigate the following three strategies: (1) fusing convolutional feature maps at differing network depths; (2) fusion of bottleneck latent representations prior to classification; and (3) score fusion. We systematically evaluate these strategies on three datasets from different domains. Our findings emphasize the benefit of integrating information fusion into the network rather than performing it by post-processing of classification scores. Furthermore, we demonstrate through a case study that already trained networks can be easily extended by the best fusion strategy, outperforming other approaches by large margin.},

Although effectiveness achieved, most existing algorithms usually focus on classiﬁcation or clustering tasks. Differently, in this paper, we focus on unsupervised representation learning and propose a novel framework termed Autoencoder in Autoencoder Networks (AE2-Nets), which integrates information from heterogeneous sources into an intact representation by the nested autoencoder framework. The proposed method has the following merits: (1) our model jointly performs view-speciﬁc representation learning (with the inner autoencoder networks) and multi-view information encoding (with the outer autoencoder networks) in a uniﬁed framework; (2) due to the degradation process from the latent representation to each single view, our model ﬂexibly balances the complementarity and consistence among multiple views. The proposed model is efﬁciently solved by the alternating direction method (ADM), and demonstrates the effectiveness compared with state-ofthe-art algorithms.},

	abstract = {This work presents an automated insect pest counting and environmental condition monitoring system using integrated camera modules and an embedded system as the sensor node in a wireless sensor network. The sensor node can be used to simultaneously acquire images of sticky paper traps and measure temperature, humidity, and light intensity levels in a greenhouse. An image processing algorithm was applied to automatically detect and count insect pests on an insect sticky trap with 93\% average temporal detection accuracy compared with manual counting. The integrated monitoring system was implemented with multiple sensor nodes in a greenhouse and experiments were performed to test the system’s performance. Experimental results show that the automatic counting of the monitoring system is comparable with manual counting, and the insect pest count information can be continuously and effectively recorded. Information on insect pest concentrations were further analyzed temporally and spatially with environmental factors. Analyses of experimental data reveal that the normalized hourly increase in the insect pest count appears to be associated with the change in light intensity, temperature, and relative humidity. With the proposed system, laborious manual counting can be circumvented and timely assessment of insect pest and environmental information can be achieved. The system also offers an efficient tool for long-term insect pest behavior observations, as well as for practical applications in integrated pest management (IPM).},

	abstract = {Insect monitoring methods are typically very time-consuming and involve substantial investment in species identification following manual trapping in the field. Insect traps are often only serviced weekly, resulting in low temporal resolution of the monitoring data, which hampers the ecological interpretation. This paper presents a portable computer vision system capable of attracting and detecting live insects. More specifically, the paper proposes detection and classification of species by recording images of live individuals attracted to a light trap. An Automated Moth Trap (AMT) with multiple light sources and a camera was designed to attract and monitor live insects during twilight and night hours. A computer vision algorithm referred to as Moth Classification and Counting (MCC), based on deep learning analysis of the captured images, tracked and counted the number of insects and identified moth species. Observations over 48 nights resulted in the capture of more than 250,000 images with an average of 5675 images per night. A customized convolutional neural network was trained on 2000 labeled images of live moths represented by eight different classes, achieving a high validation F1-score of 0.93. The algorithm measured an average classification and tracking F1-score of 0.71 and a tracking detection rate of 0.79. Overall, the proposed computer vision system and algorithm showed promising results as a low-cost solution for non-destructive and automatic monitoring of moths.},

	abstract = {The ability to use inexpensive, noninvasive sensors to accurately classify flying insects would have significant implications for entomological research, and allow for the development of many useful applications in vector control for both medical and agricultural entomology. Given this, the last sixty years have seen many research efforts on this task. To date, however, none of this research has had a lasting impact. In this work, we explain this lack of progress. We attribute the stagnation on this problem to several factors, including the use of acoustic sensing devices, the overreliance on the single feature of wingbeat frequency, and the attempts to learn complex models with relatively little data. In contrast, we show that pseudo-acoustic optical sensors can produce vastly superior data, that we can exploit additional features, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect’s flight behavior, and that a Bayesian classification approach allows us to efficiently learn classification models that are very robust to overfitting. We demonstrate our findings with large scale experiments, as measured both by the number of insects and the number of species considered.},

In the past century, the extent and intensity of artificial night lighting has increased such that it has substantial effects on the biology and ecology of species in the wild. We distinguish “astronomical light pollution”, which obscures the view of the night sky, from “ecological light pollution”, which alters natural light regimes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Some of the catastrophic consequences of light for certain taxonomic groups are well known, such as the deaths of migratory birds around tall lighted structures, and those of hatchling sea turtles disoriented by lights on their natal beaches. The more subtle influences of artificial night lighting on the behavior and community ecology of species are less well recognized, and constitute a new focus for research in ecology and a pressing conservation challenge.},

	abstract = {Ongoing climate change is mainly evident as increased in average temperature. It is expected to have a significant impact on world's biomes, with forest ecosystems especially vulnerable to these changes. The effect of climate change on forests is both indirect, through its impact on various tree species of different ecological requirements, and direct, through its impact on all living components of the forest ecosystem. Among the latter, insects are the group of the greatest importance, including species detrimental to forest health. The impact of climate change on forest insects may be reflected in their distribution, phenology, activity, number of generations and, indirectly, through impact on their natural enemies. Predicting the future direction and pace of the climate change, as well as direct and indirect consequences of its effect on forest insects is difficult and often subject to considerable inaccuracy. 
 
The paper presents a review of data from the published literature in this area of study. The influence of the basic climate parameters, temperature and humidity, on forest herbivore insects is discussed, particularly in the context of the most probable scenarios of climate change, i.e. the gradual increase in the average temperature. Observed and projected impacts of climate change in relation to the influence of herbivorous insects on forest ecosystems are characterized. We present some of the possible adaptation strategies of forest management to the expected climate changes.},

	abstract = {Scientific findings need to be verifiable and grounded in repeatability. With specimen-level research this is in part achieved with the deposition of voucher specimens. These are labeled, curated, data-based specimens that have been deposited in a collection or museum, available for verification of the work and to ensure researchers are calling the same taxa by the same names. Voucher specimens themselves are the subject of research, from the discovery of new species by taxonomists to ecologists documenting historical records of invasive species. Our objective was to quantify the frequency of voucher specimen deposition in biodiversity and community ecology research through a survey of the peer-reviewed literature about arthropods, from 1989 until 2014. Overall rates of voucher deposition were alarmingly low, at under 25\%. This rate increased significantly over time, with 35\% of papers reporting on vouchers in 2014. Relative to the global mean, entomological research had a significantly higher rate of voucher deposition (46\%), whereas researchers studying crustaceans deposited vouchers less than 6\% of the time, significantly less than the mean. Researchers working in museums had a significantly higher frequency of voucher deposition. Our results suggest a significant culture shift about the process of vouchering specimens is required. There must be more education and mentoring about voucher specimens within laboratories and across different fields of study. Principal investigators and granting agencies need a proactive approach to ensuring specimen-level data are properly, long-term curated. Editorial boards and journals can also adopt policies to ensure papers are published only if explicit statements about the deposition of voucher specimens is provided. Although the gap is significant, achieving a higher rate of voucher specimen deposition is a worthy goal to ensure all research efforts are preserved for future generations.},
