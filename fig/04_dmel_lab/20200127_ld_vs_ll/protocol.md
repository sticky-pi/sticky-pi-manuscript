In order to assess the circadian rhythm of populations of flying insects in the laboratory, 
we placed approximately 1500 CO2-anesthesised Drosophila melanogaster individuals in a 950 mL (16 oz) deli container, 
with 100 mL of agar(2%), sucrose (5%) and proprionic acid (0.5%) medium. 
The top of this primary container was closed with a mosquito net, and a 3 mm hole was pierced on its side,
40mm from the bottom, and blocked with a removable cap. 
Each cup was then placed in a large (25×25×50 cm) rectangular cage (secondary container), and all cages were held inside an incubator. 
In the back of each cage, we placed a sticky pi device that had been modified to use infrared, instead of visible, light.
In addition, 100 mL of media were available in an open container, inside each cage, so that escaping animals could freely feed. 
Animals were left at least 48h to entrain and recover from anesthesia before the small aperture in primary container was opened.
The small diameter of the aperture meant the escape rate, over a few days, was near-stationary.


The D. melanogaster population was a mixture of CantonS males and females from three to five days old, and the number of individual was 
approximated by weighting animals (average fly weight = 8.4 10^{-4} g).
During the experiments the temperature of the incubators was maintained at 25C and the relative humidity, between 40 and 60%. 
All animals were entrained in a 12:12 Light:Dark regime.
